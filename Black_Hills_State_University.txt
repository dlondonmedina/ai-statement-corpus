Since late 2022, Higher Ed has been awash in editorials on artificial intelligence and the future of college instruction. As more students learn to use ChatGPT and a host of related generative AI platforms, faculty globally are wrestling with difficult questions and changing the way they teach. In this workshop, which is intended for faculty who feel under-informed and under-prepared for teaching in the era of widespread generative AI, we’ll share key information about generative AI in 2023, what to expect from student behavior, and foundational strategies for navigating opportunities and risks as an educator.
