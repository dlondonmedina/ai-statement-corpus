 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Resources

With the rapid advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), higher education institutions must engage in thoughtful discussion about AI’s impact on teaching, learning, curriculum, research, careers, and the broader societal implications. We have developed this page of resources, organized by themes, to keep our faculty and staff informed about AI. Because AI tools and news about AI are rapidly evolving, this site will be reviewed and updated regularly. (last reviewed 3/5/24)
