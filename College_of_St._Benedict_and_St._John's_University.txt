CSB and SJU instructors: This page shares resources and recommendations to help you communicate expectations around student use of generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, in your courses.
If you'd like to share your own syllabus statement or other resources, please email Diana at dsymons@csbsju.edu and she'll add it to this page.

The following resources were also recommended by Laura Taylor, Director of the Center for Teaching and Learning:
Academic disciplines broadly, and individual CSB and SJU faculty members more specifically, have varied takes on what constitutes "appropriate" student use of generative AI tools. It's important for every instructor to provide a syllabus statement that clearly communicates the expectations for your particular course.  
Sample statements for reference:
For more sample policies, see Classroom Policies for AI Generative Tools, a list curated by Lance Eaton, Director of Digital Pedagogy at College Unbound.
Be explicit about the policies you've set and why. Go over your syllabus statement with your class early on in the semester, and help students understand how your policies align with your goals for student learning. Offer additional in-class conversations throughout the semester to answer student questions and help them better understand this rapidly developing technology.
For further recommendations and considerations, see Western Michigan University's Establishing AI Policies for Your Classroom.
