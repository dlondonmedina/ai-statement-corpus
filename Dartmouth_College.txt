Dartmouth College official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence
https://dcal.dartmouth.edu/resources/teaching-methods/teaching-generative-artificial-intelligence
With powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools readily available to both learners and instructors, many are concerned about their impacts on teaching and learning. How effective are these tools? What are their limitations? Will students be able to generate solutions to assignments using them? How will this effect academic intergrity and interact with the Academic Honor Principle?
This resource offers a range of resources and considerations to help faculty begin answering these questions and make the best decisions for their individual disciplines, courses, and assignments. Because this process is so context-dependent and necessarily unique for each teaching and learning situation, this resource is not meant to be definitive or prescriptive. 
With that said, there is one recommendation that is relevant for all faculty and courses, regardless of discipline or individual approach: 
Acknowledge the existence of generative AI tools to your students and articulate your expectations of students in your course syllabus in as much detail as possible. Is it acceptable to use these tools in your course, or in specific assignments? To what degree? Is their use to be limited and, if so, how specifically (brainstorming, ideation, editing, debugging, etc.)? If you are incorporating these tools into your teaching and assignments, how should students document and cite their use of such technologies? 
The more explicit and transparent you are about the role of AI technologies in your course, as well as your rationale for these decisions, the easier you make it for students to meet your expectations and have a successful learning experience.
As the landscape of generative AI continues to rapidly evolve, we are maintaining this resource as a living document which will be updated regularly:
