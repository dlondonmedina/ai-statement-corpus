Zimpleman Artificial Intelligence Guidelines
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the use of technology to simulate human intelligence. Generative AI, a subset of
AI, uses machine learning, algorithms, and large data sets to produce human-like responses. Generative AI
tools can be used to brainstorm ideas, summarize research, produce stories or essays, generate or debug
code, write emails or resumes, among other things. In an educational setting, AI tools can complement a
learning experience. However, AI tools can also pose challenges related to academic integrity. With this
background in mind, the Zimpleman College of Business has developed the following considerations for
students and faculty for the ethical use of AI tools.
Considerations for Students
• The use of AI tools for course work or assignments will depend on faculty policies.
• Faculty policies on the use of AI for course work, assignments, or exams will vary.
• Students should consult with faculty regarding the appropriate use of AI tools for course work.
• Students who use AI tools for course work without faculty permission or without following course
policies will be in violation of the Zimpleman Academic Integrity Policy.
• For course work where AI tools are permitted, students should not solely rely on AI generated
material. Students who use AI tools should use proper attribution and citation practices and should
carefully review any AI-generated material as AI-generated content can be inaccurate, misleading,
entirely fabricated (e.g., deepfakes), or may contain copyrighted material.
• Students are responsible for any content they use that includes AI-generated material.
Considerations for Faculty
• Faculty are encouraged to use class time to communicate their expectations regarding allowing, or
not allowing the use of AI tools for coursework.
• Faculty should include AI policies or expectations in their syllabi and/or on individual course
assignments.
• Faculty should encourage critical thinking ensuring that students do not become overly reliant on AI
tools for learning.
• Faculty should not rely on single-type assessment methods for a course (i.e., consider a mix of
assessment methods).
• Faculty should evaluate assessment methods to consider the impact of AI tools. For example, faculty
should enter assignment prompts into AI tools to see the results to validate that assessment method
is sound.
• Faculty should establish a step-by-step plan for how they will address suspected student misuse of AI
tools per their course policies. For example, per the academic integrity policy, if an instructor assigns
a penalty to an assessment related to academic integrity, the incident must be immediately reported
in writing to the Associate Dean of Student Affairs. For more details see Zimpleman Academic
Integrity Policy.
• Faculty should be aware that AI detection tools are not perfectly reliable for detecting academic
integrity issues and need to consider the risk of false positives.
• Faculty are encouraged to regularly review AI course policies as new developments emerge.

Example AI Policy for Syllabi1
This course is designed to encourage original critical thinking. Generative AI tools may be utilized as a support
tool for academic work in this course, provided that the following guidelines are adhered to:
• Proper Citation: All work generated or assisted by generative AI tools must be appropriately cited.
Citations should include the name of the AI tool used, its version (if applicable), and any other
relevant information necessary for others to identify and access the tool.
• Transparency: Students must be transparent about the use of generative AI tools in their academic
work. This includes clearly indicating which portions of their work were generated or assisted by AI.
• Originality: While the use of generative AI tools is permitted, students are expected to maintain the
integrity of their work and ensure that it remains original. Students should not rely solely on AI-
generated content without engaging in critical thinking, analysis, and synthesis of the material.
• Understanding and Learning: The primary goal of assignments is to foster understanding and
learning. Therefore, students are encouraged to use generative AI tools as a support mechanism to
enhance their comprehension of course material. Merely regurgitating AI-generated content without
understanding the underlying concepts is discouraged.
• Academic Integrity: Utilizing generative AI tools does not exempt students from adhering to
academic integrity standards. Plagiarism, including the submission of AI-generated content without
proper citation, will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action.
• Instructor Guidance: Students are encouraged to consult with the instructor regarding the
appropriate use of generative AI tools for specific assignments. The instructor may provide additional
guidance or limitations on the use of AI tools based on the nature of the assignment and learning
objectives.
