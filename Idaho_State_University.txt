The history and purposes of academic grading have led academia to conflicting expectations and approaches both on the part of teacher and student. In many cases, grades have come to represent something other than accomplishment of course objectives, often resulting in a discouraging experience for those who grade. Different perspectives will be provided against the backdrop of current practices so that teachers and institutions can consider potential improvements to said current practices.

Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders experience emotional and social difficulties, and related literature shows that most of these emotional and social difficulties are unique to these children compared to typically developing children. Since children with ASD spend most of their time in school settings, teachers should have enough knowledge and skills to provide additional social and emotional support to students with ASD. Furthermore, teachers, as first responders, should know how to regulate their emotions and improve the social interactions of these children with their peers, and parents in different settings. Placing children without meeting their social and emotional needs may have adverse impacts on academic and behavioral outcomes in school environments, and can cause a lack of access to learning and a reduction in the learning ability of all students. Thus, the development of effective strategies for social and emotional learning of children with ASD is critical in school settings. In contrast, teachers’ knowledge in responding to social and emotional needs in this population is limited. Thus, high-quality professional development courses are essential approaches for teachers to gain knowledge and skills in early identification and intervention of social and emotional problems. The main purpose of this professional development course is to provide appropriate knowledge to teachers to help these students in meeting their needs in social and emotional areas.

The purpose of this professional development course is to help elementary teachers looking to incorporate engineering design and STEM into their pedagogy. Engineering design, an integral part of STEM education, is an engaging, hands-on method focused on problem-solving, perseverance, and integration of content. It is also a ripe environment for developing interpersonal skills like communication and collaboration. As such, this course will present engineering design as the central vehicle for learning rather than a fun add-on to a lesson or unit. Learners will understand what engineering design looks like at the elementary level, how to plan meaningful engineering projects for students, and how to guide students through the process.
