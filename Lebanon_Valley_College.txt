The First-year Experience (FYE) at LVC introduces our students to the best of the college: intensive intellectual questioning, meaningful relationships with faculty and students in a close community setting, and focused development of the competencies necessary for success at college and beyond.
Your FYE will develop your critical thinking and communication skills, while also supporting you through your transition into college life. FYE classes have two components: first, a core 3-credit class focused on traditional academic skills like writing and analysis, and, second, a companion 1-credit class focused on transitional skills like coping with stress, planning for your career, managing time, and understanding major and general education requirements. Transfer students will take a different version of this 1-credit class that is tailored to supporting their successful transition to LVC.
Your FYE will provide you not only with the skills necessary to succeed academically at LVC, but also the community and relationships necessary to thrive here so that you will be ready to take advantage of the many opportunities LVC offers.
Please take a few minutes to review the FYE requirements and sections that are scheduled for Fall 2024. You will make your FYE selections in advance of New Student Advising, which begins in May.

Students who have enrolled in the honors program are asked to select one of the following FYE courses.
On Thought, Action, and Sustainability
This course is reserved for incoming Honors students. The readings and assignments will be built around the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals that aim to provide “a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.” Class discussions will tap into students’ own curiosity, passion, creativity, and sense of responsibility to include a distinctive learner-directed environment and philosophy that are the hallmarks of an Honors program.

The course analyzes texts and visual arts (film, paintings, architecture, sculpture, stage performance) from the eighteenth century onward, focus on Europe and America, regarding the depiction of energy and effects of new energy forms on society. Examples are “King Steam” and the machine age with smog, electricity as source of entertainment, object of a public discourse on danger, energy form of a new century. Nuclear energy as “our friend” and as a source of fear. The course includes several text types (e.g., short stories, longer narrative, novel-excerpt and movie adaptation of a novel), a range of genres (e.g., Mythology, Naturalism, Victorian Disaster narratives, Science Fiction, “Science Factual”, Thriller), and several art movements (e.g., Impressionism, Futurism, Expressionism, Art Nouveau, Bauhaus).

The following FYE may be taken by Exploratory (undecided) majors.
Do you feel you are the only student undecided about your college major? Would you like to have an answer to the nagging question “So, what’s your major?” It’s normal to feel a little overwhelmed about how you will make this decision. This course will help students to understand the connection between major and career. Your college major opens the doorway to many career possibilities, but it’s up to you to make the most of your experience both in and out of the classroom. The world of work today is complex and dynamic. Through applied learning including interactive experiences, texts, film, and podcasts, students will critically examine and explore academic majors available at LVC. This course is restricted for Exploratory majors only.

This class seeks to empower students to move beyond notions of “common sense” and mere opinion on ideas of social justice. Drawing on academic literature, popular culture, and experiences in their own lives, students will critically engage fundamental ideas of justice, freedom, and society and complex issues of social inequality, oppression, and structural violence. Students will explore issues of justice that impact our social identities (race, gender, ethnicity, class, religion, sexualities, ability, and body image) and show up in every level of culture education, politics, social media, entertainment, and religious/spiritual life). Students will develop the skills to not only engage these issues intellectually but reflect on how these concepts operate in their daily lives intellectually, emotionally, and bodily. Priority for this FYE is given to students who have enrolled in the Social Justice learning community.

Our brain makes us who we are. It regulates how we think, what we remember, how we react to situations, how we speak, and how we move.  This seminar explores the brain from a dysfunction perspective by incorporating how brain diseases and injury affect behavior and function. There are many famous cases such as those of Phineas Gage and Louis Victor Leborgne and stories illustrated by Oliver Sacks and others that have provided great insight into the relationship between brain anatomy and function. In this seminar, will use books, short stories, research articles, and films to discuss this relationship and also explore how recent advances in neuroscience have helped us to better understand how the brain works.

Amish and similar groups have been a part of Pennsylvania for a long time, but they also live in 30 other states and beyond. They are often seen as outsider, imagined as saints, or as a group with dark secrets. They have become a part of pop culture, from tourism and furniture to romance novels. In this course, we will explore the main ideas and beliefs of Amish and the main ways how non-Amish perceive them. We will analyze how Amish are depicted pop culture, for example, literature, television, and movies, to answer the questions: why do the Amish live that way and why are they so fascinating to many of us?

Beer, wine, and bread. Civilization would not have developed without these everyday items. Ancient peoples may not have known it, but all of these items are products of biotechnology. Today, biotechnology influences our health, what we eat, what we wear, how we heat our homes, and many other things we take for granted.  Civilization as we know it has been brought to you by several thousand years of advances in biotechnology.

Our human body defines our species. Our complex living system is the seat of consciousness and the machine that replicates and transmits our code for continued life. As the physical extension and stored repository of our worldly experiences, our body is crucial to self-identity. It is no surprise, then, that the depiction of the body is central to art. Our desires, ourself-doubts, and our prejudices are all found in the way we represent ourselves. Through various modes of critical thinking, writing, and art-making we will uncover, complicate, and question the history of human embodiment in the visual arts.

Calling hobbyists, tinkerers, doodlers, aspiring Bake-Off contestants, artists, inventors, and the making-curious! In Make(r)Space, we’ll explore the act of making things and how we think about those actions in terms of creativity, functionality, and physical interaction with materials. We’ll study the art of attention by considering how we use our time and where we put our energy, and we’ll consider how we communicate our experiences and our research to a variety of audiences through both shared class experiences and individual projects. In a world of increasingly ephemeral digital interactions and high-stakes final products, Make(r)Space invites us instead to engage with process, practice attitudes of flexibility and resilience, and connect with ways of making. And we’ll make some stuff. The only thing you need is willingness to try.

Over the past one hundred years, the American film industry, driven by Hollywood, has emerged as a global force, creating narratives that entertain audiences around the world. More importantly, film plays a powerful role in shaping how we look at the people around us, whether it’s subconsciously reinforcing an existing stereotype or outright challenging a dominant norm. This course will examine how contemporary films reflect, construct, and question the dominant image and understanding of America’s diverse societies and culture, focusing particularly on race, ethnicity, gender, class, and sexuality. By placing films within their broader historical and cultural contexts, students will learn to analyze and understand films as sociological and ideological productions.

What is the “good life?” Does wearing the motto saying so make it so? Does going to college for a better life make it so? In a world where just about everything is for sale, how is the good life not also? Questions concerning the good and the good life have long been explored. In this course, we will examine how our understanding of what makes a good life may be shaped or derailed by social media, modern lifestyles, globalization, branding, racism, or the desire to have it all! We’ll read different types of texts, from philosophy to fiction to op-eds. We’ll also watch big screen and TV films. Foremost, we will emphasize how writing is not just for papers and grades, but for finding one’s voice and learning how to think. Class will be discussion based, around a text or a film, to promote dialogue and understanding. Writing assignments will promote the intellectual skills of inquiry and analysis and encourage you to examine your own moral commitments and vision for social responsibility.

From Beowulf to The Walking Dead, art has expressed people’s fascination with monsters and violent mayhem. Though the horror genre has always been popular, it is also often dismissed as lowbrow, even exploitative, entertainment that caters to humanity’s baser instincts. In this class, we will confront that point of view by looking at the ways in which horror entertainment both reflects and challenges the cultures in which it is produced. We will analyze a variety of texts, including Mary Shelley’s novel Frankenstein and George Romero’s film “Night of the Living Dead”. Students will learn about milestones in the development of the horror genre in film and literature, gain an understanding of introductory terminology in film and literary analysis, and discover the main theories about why audiences enjoy horror. Students must take the corresponding companion course of FYE-112C, as evident by matching section numbers.
