Policies

The purpose of this Use of Generative AI in Employment Policy (“Policy”) is to provide guidelines for the use of generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) (e.g., ChatGPT, etc.) to employees of Lindenwood University and those performing work and/or services for Lindenwood. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can generate content, such as art, music, or text, and other forms of creative content typically associated with human creativity.

This policy addresses the use of Generative AI in employment in this rapidly changing and developing area and is subject to updates that correspond to developments in Generative AI.
This policy applies to all employees of Lindenwood University and those performing work and/or services for Lindenwood.
This Policy covers the use of Generative AI for University purposes. It does not apply to the use of Generative AI for purely personal reasons.
