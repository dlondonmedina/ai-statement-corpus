Dear Colleagues,
 
In recent months, artificial intelligence (AI) became the focus of conversation in many institutes of higher education, including Loyola University Chicago, as faculty, students, staff, and administrators struggled with ways to allow AI into the classroom and beyond in constructive practices. These tools are here to stay and will continue to shape our futures in education, the world of work, science, technology, and research.
 
All of us at Loyola University Chicago have an obligation to complete our academic and scholarly work with absolute integrity and honesty. We must always uphold our Community Standards and academic policies.
 
To maintain our culture of excellence and integrity, students are not to use AI assisted technology in the classroom unless they are specifically authorized to do so by their faculty for an assignment, a test, a quiz, or any deliverable that will be graded. 
 
We have much to learn regarding the benefits of tools such as ChatGPT or Google’s Bard. Let us all make sure we are learning and sharing best practices and not allowing AI to do the learning for us. Faculty, whether you allow the use of generative AI or not in your classes is of course up to you, but you should include a statement in your syllabus stating your expectations regarding student use of AI. Students, you came here for your own education. With this opportunity comes an important responsibility to honor, respect, and carry forward Loyola’s proud tradition of excellence in all that you do.
 
Loyola will continue evaluating and responding to the opportunities and challenges these tools present and we will share more updates as they are available.
 
Sincerely,
 
Margaret Faut Callahan, CRNA, PhD, FNAP, FAAN
Provost and Chief Academic Officer
