Dr. Eric Brown, vice president and senior technical fellow and product manager for Elemental Cognition’s Research and Discovery solution, presented “AI- AI-powered Research and Discovery for Life Science Literature Review” at a February 8 webinar to an audience of MGH Institute and Mass General Brigham employees.
Dr. Brown discussed the company’s pioneering a new approach by combining generative AI and large-language models with an extra layer of logical reasoning that aims to create hybrid systems “that never hallucinate.” This innovative work, known as Cora, is revolutionizing life sciences research and development, offering solutions in drug repurposing, supporting researchers’ thought processes, and automating solution exploration.
