Serving the MIT community as well as journalists and the general public, the Institute Office of Communications (IOC) manages platforms including MIT News, the MIT Daily/Weekly and other newsletters, the MIT homepage and associated web pages, the MIT YouTube channel, and Institute-level social media accounts.
Maintaining the trust of our audiences is paramount, which means our content on these public-facing platforms must be accurate, above all, and meet high editorial standards.
With these observations in mind, we have adopted the following principles, effective Dec. 6, 2023, to guide the use of generative AI in content appearing on IOC channels. These guidelines reflect input from communicators both inside and outside the IOC, as well as MIT faculty members:
While other MIT departments, labs, and centers are welcome to adopt these guidelines for their own communications purposes, they are also free to pursue their own approaches.
These guidelines will change as AI and its use throughout society continue to evolve. In the event of significant changes to this guidance, we will communicate those changes to colleagues around the Institute. For now, we believe the principles outlined above will help us maintain the trust, accuracy, and editorial standards that our audiences have come to expect of us, while allowing for the responsible adoption of new technologies that have the potential to enhance our communications.
