Before you write a policy about AI, you need to understand how available AI tools might be used by your students. Spend some time engaging with AI to see how it can be used productively, or not, with the assignments you intend to give your students. You may find this “play” will lead to assignment revision, and it will certainly help you develop a useful approach to guiding students on appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI. Very likely, you will find that your guidance and policies will need to be catered to different types of assignments.
As of 05/15/2023, the University’s Academic Dishonesty policy has changed slightly to include a clause on work completed by entities that are not human: “Academic dishonesty is any attempt by a student to submit 1) work completed by another person or entity without proper citation or 2) to give improper aid to another student in the completion of an assignment, such as plagiarism.” This change helps establish, at institutional level, that submitting AI-generated content in place of one’s own work constitutes plagiarism.
At the individual course level, you may consider adding a clarifying statement to your syllabus, such as:
A few other AI-related things to consider adding to the syllabus:
All courses will very likely not have the same policy. That’s part of what we need to teach students — that faculty are designing courses and assignments with different purposes and directions, and thus careful attention to directions around the appropriate use of AI needs to become part of students’ regular practice.
If you are looking for ideas for syllabus language, Montclair faculty statements are being collected, and Lance Eaton of College Unbound has organized this diverse collection of statements from faculty active in AI discussions.
