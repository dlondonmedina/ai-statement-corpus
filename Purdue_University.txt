Purdue University official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence

Recent advancements in publicly available software like ChatGPT, BingAI, Claude, Dall-E, and Codex have spurred discussion on the effective use of AI in Higher Education. Innovative Learning and Teaching@Purdue have aggregated several resources for Purdue instructors. To the left is an overview of generative AI applications, considerations for your course syllabus and assignments, and creative uses of AI in educational settings.
Purdue University continues to support the autonomy and choice of faculty and instructors to utilize instructional technology that best suits their teaching and learning environments. As such, there is no official university policy restricting or governing the use of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models or similar generative technologies. However, as a result of considerable interest and requests from instructors, Innovative Learning has compiled several resources and suggestions for exploring the effect of these tools on your teaching practice.
In Fall 2023 Innovative Learning will offer several workshops to engage instructors with common AI software like ChatGPT. You can find them on the workshop calendar here. The Introduction to Large Language Model trainings will be run September 5, 6 & 7. Recordings of the initial sessions are linked below:
