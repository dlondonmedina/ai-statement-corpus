We provide Canvas and instructional technology training prior to the beginning of each semester. Faculty are always welcome to contact the Head of Instructional Design to discuss Canvas LMS and other instructional design and technology questions. Access our Canvas LMS at https://canvas.rmc.edu; use your RMC email and password to sign in. We invite you to visit two resources on using Canvas:

We not only provide support on how to use and troubleshoot instructional technology systems, but also how they can be incorporated into course design to enhance learning and student engagement. The Head of Instructional Design & Technology consults with faculty on strategies and practices related to active learning, student collaboration, and assessment of learning. Faculty receive assistance in assignment design and exploring diverse ways for students to learn and demonstrate academic progress.
We have created the Teaching Toolkit website for faculty, which includes tutorials on technology tools by function and by pedagogical goal, a searchable FAQ database, and current books and articles on teaching and learning.
We would like to invite faculty to consider using Digital Storytelling to enhance student learning and engagement.
