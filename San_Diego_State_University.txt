San Diego State University official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence
https://it.sdsu.edu/projects-innovation/ai
Welcome to the Academic Applications of AI (AAAI) micro-credential program, a product of the collaboration between Academic Affairs' Center for Teaching & Learning (CTL) and the IT Division's Instructional Technology Services (ITS). This initiative, crafted by Academic AI Fellows, empowers faculty to leverage AI in education and research creatively and responsibly. 
Join us for a groundbreaking summit set to redefine the future of AI education. SDSU invites all 23 California State University System campuses to collaborate, share knowledge, and advance AI instruction on a state-wide scale.
SDSU’s Academic Applications of AI Micro-Credential prepares you to apply generative AI technology efficiently, effectively, and ethically to level up learning in the classes you teach.
This resource provides the instrument for a student survey on artificial intelligence administered at San Diego State University in fall 2023, drawing participation from almost 8,000 students.
Our commitment to student feedback sets this collaboration apart. Results from an in-depth Fall 2023 AI Student Survey (n = 7,811) will guide the refinement of both the Micro-Credential and the upcoming Academic AI Summit (invitation-only), hosted by San Diego State University in Spring 2024 and uniting all 23 California State University campuses. Join us in shaping the future of AI in education and research!
