Here we have assembled resources related to the advent of generative AI (Artificial
                  Intelligence) and ChatGPT and its implications for university instruction. SJSU colleagues
                  continue to curate resources to help you navigate this moment.  As always, if you have any questions or suggestions, please
                  contact us at cfd@sjsu.edu.
