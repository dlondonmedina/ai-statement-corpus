Blockchain
Blockchain technology, defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology as a distributed digital ledger of cryptographically-signed transactions that are grouped into blocks. Each block is cryptographically linked to the previous (making it tamper evident) after validation and undergoing a consensus decision. As new blocks are added, older blocks become more difficult to modify (creating tamper resistance). New blocks are replicated across copies of the ledger within the network, and any conflicts are resolved automatically using established rules. Blockchain, as we know it today, has concepts that can be traced back as far as 1979 to computer scientist Ralph Merkle, who patented his idea known as the Merkle tree that provides data structure for verifying individual records. More recently, cryptocurrency was introduced in 2009 and the blockchain concept was validated, launching this type of technology to the front of innovation.
In the last for years, interest in using blockchain technology in industries other than cryptocurrency has surged prompting UAT to incorporate a Blockchain module to our Graduate Degree options. Professor Rawad Habib states about the module “UAT has a very unique Blockchain path for its Master students. Module related to Blockchain technology covers foundational concepts such as distributed ledgers, cryptography, consensus mechanisms, and the practical implementation of Blockchain solutions. Also, we have a powerful Blockchain coding class.The relevance of Blockchain has grown significantly due to its transformative potential across various industries. Originally introduced as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain has evolved into a decentralized and secure ledger system with applications extending beyond finance.The Blockchain graduate module would likely go deep into the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and the broader impact of Blockchain technology.”
 
ChatGPT
ChatGPT is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) large language model that’s current version was launched in November 2022 by OpenAI. This new technology has created a buzz around AI and its capabilities. ChatGPT’s ability to learn from the user and create has caused some mixed feeling about the technology and how it can and will be used.At UAT, we embrace new technologies like ChatGPT but also use it’s controversies to ensure our students are using it, and other technologies ethically.
Professor Craig Bellanger explained “Instructors generally take a positive-minded, open approach to the uses of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in classes. Professor Dapzury Valenzuela, for example, encourages students to use them to help generate ideas for Student Innovation Project as well as identify market gaps and research queries. In my own classes, LLMs are used for providing story ideas and writing prompts that students can have fun with.
Our overall approach is cautious, though. If the last year has taught us anything, it’s that nothing about AI is static, and we can expect both forward leaps and setbacks as the tech evolves around us. We’re very clear to students that using LLMs comes with an ethical responsibility on their part; acknowledgement of use followed by attribution is expected of everyone. Another important message regarding their use is that students are always expected to do their own work—it’s never okay for a student to allow an AI to do their thinking for them or turn in work generated by an LLM.”

3D Printing
3D printing has been around since the 1980’s beginning in Japan when Hideo Kodama was looking to develop a rapid prototyping system, but it wasn’t until the 2010’s that it became a main stream technology, becoming a billion dollar industry.
UAT’s Digital Maker and Fabrication (DMF) degree ensures students have access to the latest and greatest printers and printing technology. Professor Ryan Murray described the newest technology in the DMF Lab “The new technology in the maker lab has helped to keep our students using the latest in 3D printing. The newest addition is the Bambu Labs X1- Carbon. This printer has so many neat features, the first being the automatic material system. This holds four colors of filament and can change colors in the middle of the print for multi color parts. This printer uses a lidar camera and AI to make sure everything is running smoothly. If something goes wrong, it will automatically pause the print saving material. It is also fast, allowing our students to test more designs.” 

Haptics
Haptic technology, defined by Merriam-Webster as the use of electronically or mechanically generated movement that a user experiences through the send of touch as part of an interface (as on a gaming console or smartphone), has been around since the 1970's. Initially implemented as a part of the gaming experience, haptics has grown through the years and more recently we've seen phone companies incorporate it into their products. UAT Professor Jake Perrine describes how UAT uses and will impact the haptic technology industry.
“The field of haptics continues to grow and is now being implemented into all different kinds of products. This is adding a whole extra dimension of feedback to the user experience across products. We can see this especially in the Virtual Reality (VR) space, where haptic gloves and vests are being developed to be used as accessories with whichever VR headset you may have. These haptic accessories open up a whole new level of immersion and functionality that we can utilize. At UAT we will use, analyze, and innovate many of the different haptic devices we see in the market today. All students at UAT are updated with the trends in the haptic space and will be completely ready for what comes next!”

As a student at UAT, I have found lots of other students who love to read just as much as I do! Having a book club on campus is super helpful for finding Book Recommendations that are both popular, and very good! This blog will be a list of 5 fantasy books that I found to be the best from my personal list of reads in 2023:

3. Thistlefoot

"An enchanted adventure illuminated by Jewish myth and adorned with lyrical prose as tantalizing and sweet as briar berries, Thistlefoot is a sweeping epic rich in Eastern European folklore: a powerful and poignant exploration of healing from multi-generational trauma told by a bold new talent." (https://www.amazon.com/Thistlefoot-Novel-GennaRose-Nethercott/dp/059346883X#:~:text=An%20enchanted%20adventure%20illuminated%20by,by%20a%20bold%20new%20talent.)
Follow two siblings as they try to flee the Longshadow Man and save their home, Thistlefoot. This book is based off of Jewish Mythology and ties in Baba Yaga as a long lost relative of the Yaga Siblings. Both of these kids have magical powers that help them escape a man who is set to harm them to get hold of what he truly wants. Bellatine, a young woman who can turn puppets into living beings, and Isaac who is able to mimic other people perfectly including stealing their voice, mannerisms, and even the body as a disguise. 
 
4.  Amari and the Night Brothers

Amari is a high school student who is on the search for her missing brother, finding that her brother actually worked as a spy within a huge school of all things supernatural. This story is best described as a mix of Harry Potter and Gravity Falls as you push through this school with Amari and meet interesting creatures like Big Foot. This is a middle grade read but it is truly phenomenal and already has a 2nd book with a 3rd on the way! 
 
5. Zachary Ying and the Dragon Emperor

If you like Percy Jackson, you will love this book. Zachary Ying is a young boy in middle school who is very separated from his heritage and culture. He comes across an exchange student from China who wants to become friends and help him learn where Zachary has come from. "The book follows Zachary Ying, a Chinese American and Hui Muslim boy on his journey to save China from a horde of ancient spirits while being guided by the spirit of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China."(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Ying_and_the_Dragon_Emperor#:~:text=The%20book%20follows%20Zachary%20Ying,first%20book%20in%20the%20series.)
This book is an enlightening experience, learning about powerful people from Chinese history and their beliefs. 
 
These are my top 5 fantasy reads of 2023, I hope you have found some new interesting titles to read and look into from this list! 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been at the top of technology-conversations during 2023. AI suggests many opportunities for innovation as it is worked into applications that make use of large datasets. Patterns learned by AI can result in better human-computer experiences, diagnosis, content creation, pattern predictions and improved workflow. As a tech, AI is such a pervasive game-changer that its emergence is leading to rethinking of laws, industry norms as the court of public opinion raises their concerns. A challenge with AI is that understanding of what it is and its “insider language” is not widely understood. In this series  we will cover AI language from A to Z. 
In the final part of this series we will cover S to Z.

In the University of Advancing Technology's Scripting for Designers (GAM218) class, Matthew Henry places his focus on coding/programming/engineering concepts for design-minded students.  
While most students wait until their final projects to put polish and pizazz into their levels, some take the time to make the levels they use to learn these tools into interesting and fun environments. 
One online student, Eryx Hortizuela, has excelled in her studies and took the time to make their extra life "fire" as seen in her presentation video.  This video was created in her second week of a five-week class, after learning all of the scripting required to create this sample level and cut scene in the first two modules. 
Well done, Eryx!
