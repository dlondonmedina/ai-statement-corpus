University of Cincinnati official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence
https://guides.libraries.uc.edu/prevent-plagiarism/genAI
Most of our students entering the workforce will be using AI daily, either by choice or by requirement. AI is less likely to eliminate jobs, than it is to transform jobs, and the difference in employability within a field will likely be down to who uses AI and who doesn't. Our students need us to allow them to use and critically discuss AI in the classroom, as applicable, while maintaining the rigor and values of our discipline areas.
Modified from the Tacoma Community College Guide For Faculty: Generative AI (ChatGPT): Leveraging generative AI in teaching and learning (under construction)
AI tools have the potential to generate academic outputs which meet the requirement of particular assessment types, including essays, reports,  tests etc.
This presents a number of key challenges for educators.
Modified from Generative Artificial Intelligence & Academic Integrity (Centre for Academic Practice, Trinity College Dublin, 2023).
The recently revised UC Student Code of Conduct lists "unauthorized use of artificial intelligence" as a form of academic misconduct under "Cheating" (p.10).
Use your syllabi to communicate whether and how generative AI tools can be used in your courses. Find links to sample syllabus statements in Resources on Generative AI and ChatGPT.
Resources listed below include tips on responding to challenges related to use of AI in student work with changes to assessment design.
