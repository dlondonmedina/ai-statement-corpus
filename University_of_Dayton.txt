University of Dayton official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence
https://vlcff.udayton.edu/courses/guidelines.php
The VLCFF prohibits the use of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, in any written work for exercises and discussion boards. All written work must be the student's original ideas, and any outside sources used, such as textbooks or articles, must be cited appropriately. In the event that the use of generative AI is suspected, the work will be checked by one or more AI detection programs. If plagiarism, the uncredited use of another's work, is suspected, the work will also be checked. If a strong indication of AI or plagiarism is determined, the student will be asked to resubmit the work.
Personal integration and articulation of what has been learned in VLCFF e-courses is crucial for authentic adult faith learning, especially for catechists or those in ministry.
