Professor of Philosophy, Julien Murphy, and Associate Professor of Communication, Maureen Ebben, published an article for Geneva Graduate Institute’s NORRAG Global Education Centre’s Policy Insights AI and Digital Inequities.
The Professors’ piece is entitled Environmental Generative AI Awareness in Education. A key take away from this piece invites educators to integrate pedagogy that foregrounds the material effects of generative artificial intelligence so that students are empowered to act responsibly and collectively to mitigate environmental disasters.
