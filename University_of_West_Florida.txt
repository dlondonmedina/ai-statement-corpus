Welcome to the University of West Florida’s Career Development Artificial Intelligence (AI) Career Toolkit! This site provides resources to help students learn about and responsibly use AI within the realm of career development.
AI has incredible potential to assist and amplify students' efforts to secure jobs and internships, but it also carries risks if not applied carefully. We have created this toolkit to empower students with knowledge so they can interact with AI systems in an ethical, safe, and beneficial way in support of their career goals. We hope you find this helpful as you navigate the fascinating world of AI.
As a student exploring and learning about AI in the context of career education, it's vital to engage with this technology thoughtfully. 
Keep these best practices in mind, but consider that this list is by no means exhaustive:


Evaluate bias - AI generally pulls information from a certain amount of data from the internet as a whole. Be wary that some of this information may be biased or not representative of every person.


Protect privacy - Be selective about sharing personal data with AI tools. Understand how your data is being stored, used, and secured by reviewing the data privacy policy page of the tool you are using.


Personally identifiable information such as names, addresses or company names should NEVER be included in an AI search.


Check transparency - Favor AI tools from companies that explain how their systems work and are open about limitations. Lack of transparency is a red flag.


Verify recommendations - AI suggestions are not always accurate. Make sure you are evaluating and tailoring the generated content to best capture your skill set, experiences, and your career planning priorities.


Consider ethics - Be mindful that AI should be used as a starting point or revision tool and should not be used to create application materials. AI text does not count as your own original writing. Avoid plagiarism by citing any sources used. You should not cite information from an AI tool directly; strive to cite from the source directly. You must uphold academic integrity.


Supplement AI with human advice - Meet with real career coaches to get personalized perspectives. AI should complement human guidance, not replace it. Consider scheduling an appointment with a career coach.
