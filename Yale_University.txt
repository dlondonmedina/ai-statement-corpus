Yale University official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence
https://provost.yale.edu/news/guidelines-use-generative-ai-tools
[Summary: The following message provides guidance to all members of the Yale community regarding the responsible use of generative AI.]
Dear Members of the Yale Community,
Publicly available generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT, Bing, Midjourney, and Bard have garnered tremendous attention in the past year. The field of generative AI is developing rapidly. While its precise impacts are unknown, this technology will transform how we learn, teach, conduct research, and carry out daily tasks. We encourage you to experiment with AI tools. As you explore AI’s potential, please adhere to the following general guidelines, which align with existing university policies and uphold our institutional commitment to safety, security, and academic integrity. 
 
1.    Protect Yale’s confidential information and your own. Do not enter confidential or legally restricted data or any data that Yale’s data classification policy identifies as moderate or high-risk into an AI tool.  If you are not sure whether you should share certain data, please review Yale’s data classification policy. 
 
2.    Assume all information shared will be made public. Treat all information shared with an AI tool as if it will become public. Do not share information that is personal or sensitive, and be mindful that the information you input into an AI tool may be retained. 
 
3.    Always follow academic integrity guidelines and institutional standards of conduct. All students and faculty are expected to know and adhere to their school’s academic integrity policies. Faculty members are expected to provide clear instructions on the permitted use of generative AI tools for academic work and requirements for attribution. Likewise, students are expected to follow their instructors’ guidelines about permitted use of AI for coursework.
 
4.    Be alert for bias and inaccuracy. AI-generated responses can be biased, inaccurate, inappropriate, or may contain unauthorized copyrighted information. We are each responsible for the content of our work product. Always review and verify outputs generated by AI tools, especially before publication.
 
5.    Protect yourself and your credentials. Never share your Yale NetID and password with AI tools, and always be aware of phishing schemes. For information, tips, and toolkits on cybersafe practices, visit Yale’s Cybersecurity website, which also includes information about security policies and standards. 
 
6.    Seek support. The university is working to support procurement practices that coordinate shared interests and minimize institutional risk. If you are considering acquiring an AI product, please conduct an initial review of the tool to ensure that it conforms to institutional security requirements. Use Yale’s purchasing intake portal or contact purchasing.helpdesk@yale.edu. 
  
Generative AI is evolving quickly, as is institutional support for utilizing these tools. For up-to-date recommendations on teaching and learning, please visit the Poorvu Center’s webpage on “AI Guidance.” Detailed AI guidelines for staff are available on Yale’s data governance website. 
As a university community dedicated to exchanging ideas, disseminating knowledge, and fostering a climate for breakthrough discoveries, we will embrace technological tools and harness their power for innovation. We must do this safely and responsibly. We thank you for your efforts in adhering to these guidelines.
Sincerely,
Scott A. Strobel
Provost
Jack F. Callahan
Senior Vice President for Operations
John P. Barden
