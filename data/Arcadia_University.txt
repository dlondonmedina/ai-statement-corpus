You may have seen images online by A.I.-based image generators such as DALL-E 2 or Stable Diffusion, which enable anyone—from award-winning photographers to those with the most rudimentary artistic ability—to create a unique image in seconds from just a simple text prompt. 
So, what does this technological advance mean for the world of art and for students of art? Are images, paintings, or posters generated by artificial intelligence programs art? 
Two faculty members in the Visual and Performing Arts department at Arcadia University, Christian Patchell and Tamsen Wojtanowski, create their own generative A.I. masterpieces in this video, address the implications this technology has on the art world, and discuss ways to incorporate artificial intelligence into their classrooms.
