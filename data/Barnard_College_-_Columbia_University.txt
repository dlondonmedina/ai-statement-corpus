Barnard College - Columbia University official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence
https://cep.barnard.edu/generative-ai-college-classroom
Educators are acting fast to consider the implications of ChatGPT and several other generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The following recommendations represent the CEP’s and IMATS' initial and ongoing research into generative artificial intelligence and its implications in the higher education classroom, with recommendations for classroom activities, assignment design, and academic honesty and ethical considerations regarding the potential risks of this technology. This faculty guide accompanies the CEP's Student Guide to Generative AI.
It is important to note that this software is evolving rapidly, and our collective understanding of what it does and how it works is likely to shift over time. As such, the CEP has consulted with IMATS and the Computational Science Center (CSC) and will continue to conduct additional research to update these recommendations.
Please contact us at pedagogy@barnard.edu if you have any feedback or questions about this resource. We are also happy to set up one-on-one consultations with instructors to discuss generative AI in their course and disciplinary contexts.
If you’re considering using generative AI or ChatGPT in the classroom, or want to discuss these technologies with your students, it is helpful to know a little bit about what these tools are and how they work. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, based on what it has learned from existing content. The process of learning from existing content is called “training,” and results in the creation of a statistical model. When given a prompt, generative AI uses this statistical model to predict what an expected response might be - and thus generate new content.   
There are many generative AI products available, including ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a product developed by OpenAI; ChatGPT 3.5 was released for public beta testing in November 2022, while ChatGPT 4 was released to paid ChatGPT Plus users in March 2023, and to a limited number of pilot users from their waiting list. Using a pre-trained language model, ChatGPT takes text prompts from users and produces responses that are supposed to mimic human writing in dialogue format. Notable features include its ability to answer questions, hold a conversation, summarize information, write computer code, among many other functions. 
ChatGPT’s language model is trained on very large datasets of text data available on the internet, including websites, books, and other texts; these datasets are estimated to contain nearly one trillion words in multiple languages. This includes labeled data, which includes annotations set by humans that guide the language model in categorizing data correctly, as well as unlabeled data (sometimes called “raw data”), which does not contain any annotations. OpenAI improved the model's accuracy by having people evaluate and correct its analysis of the unlabeled data, enhancing its ability to produce written language.
ChatGPT has a variety of limitations that are integral to understanding and working with the tool:
The following webinars and resources on generative AI in the college context may be helpful for learning about the technology and its implications for academic integrity, assignment design, student engagement, and the future of AI:
 
 
 
If you choose to incorporate generative AI into your course assignments, state explicitly how you would like students to cite their use of generative AI technology within their assignments or assessments or ask them to cite these products based on the citational system common within your discipline. The MLA has published explicit guidance on citing generative AI as has the APA. It is important to explicitly articulate your requested citation format or style in writing so students understand what is expected of them. 
These two resources can be used to guide your decision on whether or not you will incorporate generative AI in your classroom. Access a larger version of infographics here and view a pdf version here. Download as simple text PDF.
This section includes examples of syllabus statements on generative AI. There are a variety of ways in which faculty might respond to this new and continually developing technology, and instructors can use syllabi statements to define expectations for generative AI in their courses. Course policies across higher education reflect a spectrum of positions regarding students’ use of AI tools. Some instructors allow students to engage with AI in some specified way, and others forbid the use of AI products altogether. What these statements share is an acknowledgement of AI as a reality within our teaching and learning contexts and an explicit explanation of the instructor’s approach or policy. While a syllabus statement is only one way of addressing your approach to AI, the process of drafting your policy, and explicitly connecting that policy to the purpose, skills, and big ideas of your course, may also help you reflect on elements of your course design and clarify your pedagogical goals. In addition to the statements below, instructors might benefit from exploring the Classroom Policies for Generative AI Tools resource, which includes several examples of digital transparency statements across the disciplines and from various institutions.
For instructors who wish to forbid generative AI in their classes:
“Our academic community depends on integrity, shared responsibility, and academic honesty. All work in this course must be your original work and completed in accordance with the College’s Honor Code. You may not use ChatGPT or other generative AI software at any stage or in any phase in any type of work in this course, even when properly attributed. [Insert discipline- or context-specific reasons for this, including skill building, concerns regarding equity, etc.] If you have questions about what is permissible at any point in the semester, please reach out to me.”
For instructors who are open to students using generative AI in some way:
“We may incorporate ChatGPT and other generative AI software during this course [here the specific uses could be noted depending on the course and discipline]. Students will be informed about when, where, and how such tools are permitted to be used for class work and assignments, along with specific instructions for attribution. Outside of these approved uses, ChatGPT and other generative AI software are not permitted and must be specifically approved by the instructor. [If you would like them to cite these tools: Any and all use of ChatGPT and other AI software at any stage of completing assignments for this course must be properly cited in your work using [insert style guide or approach to citation]; neglecting to do so may constitute a violation of the College’s Honor Code.] If you have questions about what is permissible at any point in the semester, please reach out to me. Please also note that this policy applies only to my class, and it is your responsibility to check with each instructor if ever you are unsure about what constitutes academic honesty in their class.”
 
A Few Words about Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT)
Writing is integral to thinking. It is also hard. Natural language processing (NLP) applications like ChatGPT or Sudowrite are useful tools for helping us improve our writing and stimulate our thinking. However, they should never serve as a substitute for either. And, in this course, they cannot.    
Think of the help you get from NLP apps as a much less sophisticated version of the assistance you can receive (for free!) from a Bentley Writing Center tutor. That person might legitimately ask you a question to jump-start your imagination, steer you away from the passive voice, or identify a poorly organized paragraph, but should never do the writing for you. A major difference here, of course, is that an NLP app is not a person. It’s a machine which is adept at recognizing patterns and reflecting those patterns back at us. It cannot think for itself. And it cannot think for you.  
With that analogy in mind, you will need to adhere to the following guidelines in our class.  
Appropriate use of AI when writing essays or discussion board entries  
Inappropriate use of AI when writing essays or discussion board entries  
Evidence of inappropriate AI use will be grounds for submission of an Academic Integrity report. Sanctions will range from a zero for the assignment to an F for the course.
I’m assuming we won’t have a problem in this regard but want to make sure that the expectations are clear so that we can spend the semester learning things together—and not worrying about the origins of your work.
Be aware that other classes may have different policies and that some may forbid AI use altogether.
 
Dongwook Yoon: CPSC 344
344 Policy on the Use of AI Content Generators for the Coursework (ver 1.1, Jan 18, 2023)
Dear CPSC 344 students,
I am writing to inform you that the use of AI-based content generation tools, or AI tools, is permitted for assignments and project work in CPSC 344. However, it is not allowed during midterm exams and the final. Additionally, students are required to disclose any use of AI tools for each assignment. Failure to follow this policy will be considered a violation of UBC’s academic policy.
I view AI tools as a powerful resource that you can learn to embrace.
The goal is to develop your resilience to automation, as these tools will become increasingly prevalent in the future. By incorporating these tools into your work process, you will be able to focus on skills that will remain relevant despite the rise of automation. Furthermore, I believe that these tools can be beneficial for ESL students and those who have been disadvantaged, allowing them to express their ideas in a more articulate and efficient manner.
We are aware that there are risks involved in allowing the use of AI tools in your assignment deliverables.
Therefore, we ask that you read this carefully and use the tools responsibly.
Firstly, it is important to note that AI tools are susceptible to errors and may incorporate discriminatory ideas in their output. As a student, it is your responsibility to ensure the quality and appropriateness of the work you submit in this course.
Secondly, please be mindful of the data you provide to these systems, as your assignments contain private information, not just your own but also that of others. For example, you should never enter the names of your study participants into ChatGPT.
Thirdly, there is a risk of inadvertently plagiarizing when using these tools. Many AI chatbots and image generators create content based on existing bodies of work without proper citation. Our plagiarism policy will apply to all assignment submissions, and “AI did it!” will not excuse any plagiarism. To prevent this, you can consider using more responsible tools that cite their data sources, such as Perplexity AI.
Lastly, be aware of the dangers of becoming overly dependent on these tools. While they can be incredibly useful, relying on them too much can diminish your own critical thinking and writing skills.
For every assignment submission, you are required to complete a form called the “AI use disclosure.”
Submitting this disclosure will help us understand and mitigate the risks associated with the use of AI tools in the course. The form will ask about your use of AI tools for the assignment and the extent to which you used them. You will be asked to submit the disclosure via Canvas.
If you do not wish to use these tools, that is a valid decision.
The use of AI tools in education can be messy and unpredictable due to the risks mentioned earlier. Some students may have moral confusion or concerns about the uncertainty associated with using AI tools in their coursework. If you do not wish to use them, that is a valid decision. This policy aims to anticipate and mitigate any potential harms associated with AI tool usage, rather than promoting their use.
We will not mark you down for the use or non-use of AI tools.
Grading will be done based on the rubric on an absolute scale, so students who do not use AI tools will not be at a disadvantage. Also, the use of AI tools will not negatively impact your grade. The instructor will be the only one with access to the submitted AI use disclosures, and TAs will handle the majority of grading.
Please note that the policy about the use of AI tools in CPSC 344 is up for change as the term progresses.
Best,
Dongwook Yoon
