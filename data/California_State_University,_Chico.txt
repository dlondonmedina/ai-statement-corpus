Asynchronous AI Retrofit Course now AvailableEnroll in this asynchronous Canvas course(opens in new window) for a step-by-step guide to course revision in the world of Generative Artificial Intelligence. The world has changed, and this will help you change with it.
Faculty have had a wide variety of reactions to artificial intelligence (AI) programs that generate language, solve problems, create images, and write code. There is no one-size-fits-all policy for the campus, and we will provide resources to help faculty explore some of these new possibilities. 
Things to keep in mind
Sample syllabi language
CSU Chancellor's Office: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools for Teaching and Learning
As part of the CSU's commitment to foster faculty professional growth in innovative teaching and learning, Innovative Teaching & Future Faculty Development and Academic Technology Services in the Chancellor's Office are partnering to offer the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools for Teaching and Learning over the next few semesters.
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence tools where guided experimentation empowers participants to understand some of the basics of AI functionality, including its workings and methods for detecting its usage. Learn basic AI terminology, engage in hands-on exploration of AI Tools, learn strategies for detecting AI-generated content, and techniques to address potential misuse of AI tools by students and participants will apply the knowledge gained to develop a personalized AI use policy for their course.
The course is designed by Laura Otero, Online Education Coordinator in the Center for Academic Technologies (CAT) at CSU Monterey Bay and was originally offered in Summer 2023 to over 100 faculty at CSU Monterey Bay. In Fall 2023, it was offered across the CSU to 150 faculty, instructional designers, faculty developers, and academic technologists.

CSU Learn: Managing The Responsible Use Of AI(opens in new window)
As more and more workforces try to leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI), it is crucial for organizations to establish clear communication and strategic planning when integrating AI into daily work. In this scenario, you are the IT director discussing the potential use of AI with one of the team managers within the company. Your company has approved the use of AI for improving productivity and efficiency, but you need to ensure that privacy and security guidelines are being followed. Exploring ways in which teams can use AI in a responsible manner that is in accordance with company policies is an important step when embracing any new technology.

We acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.
