Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Dall-E are becoming more and more commonly used for developing ideas, generating new text, and creating custom images. Naturally, this has led to significant debate over if and how students and scholars should attribute content generated by AI in their work.
Though you may have generated AI content, it is still based on the work of others and needs to be cited just as you would when using another persons’ words or images. Citing when you use AI content also helps ensure you are avoiding potential plagiarism and providing accurate information about what your work is based on. Here is some guidance for attributing AI-generated content in three of the most common citation styles:
MLA:
