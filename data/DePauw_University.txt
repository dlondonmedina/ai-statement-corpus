This guide is intended to be a starting point for information on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and ChatGPT.  How can these tools be used in the classroom by students or faculty? 
ChatGPT: "A large language model tool that uses artificial intelligence (more specifically, natural language processing), to answer user-generated prompts. It was developed by OpenAI using the GPT 3.5 (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) and is currently available for public use."  (from McGill University Library LibGuide on AI).
McGill University Library has also provided an AI Key Terms and Definitions list and a Family Tree graphic showing the relationships between different applications and AI.
