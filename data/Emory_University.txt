Emory University official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence
https://guides.libraries.emory.edu/AI/teaching
Always confirm with your professor whether using artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT is acceptable for each assignment.
Be sure to verify the information as well as the sources generated by AI tools, as AI has been known to generate false information and to cite non-existent sources.
Guidelines around the use and reference of AI are evolving, so citation recommendations will be refreshed over time. Check back for updates.
Note that all of the tools mentioned here are for individual use; Emory does not subscribe to or endorse any of these tools at this time.
