HPU Associate Professor and Program Chair of Business Analytics Ghazwan Hassna, Ph.D., has been invited to author a pivotal article for Apolitical, a leading global platform for people working in Government. Used by over 200,000 public servants and policymakers worldwide, and co-designed and funded by governments, Apolitical serves as a significant channel for impactful conversations on public service and policy.
Hassna's article entitled “Shaping the future: Governing the generative AI revolution” brings attention to the urgent need for comprehensive policy frameworks that ensures the responsible and ethical deployment of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI).
“Being invited to write for Apolitical underlines the significance of having multi-disciplinary dialogues around Generative AI policy," said Hassna. “The transformative potential of this technology requires balanced, comprehensive frameworks that can only be achieved through collaborative efforts among policymakers, academic institutions, and industry experts.”
Key Takeaways from the Article:
 
The article provides a timely analysis, especially in the wake of recent research by Goldman Sachs, that suggests Generative AI could lead to a 7% increase in global GDP and significantly boost productivity.
Hassna's invited contribution to Apolitical exemplifies HPU’s commitment to cutting-edge research and global dialogue on pressing policy challenges.
