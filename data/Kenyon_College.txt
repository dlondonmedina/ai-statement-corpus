Browse useful resources as you teach about, with or against generative artificial intelligence tools.
The Office of Digital Learning & Inquiry at Middlebury College has an open online "Digital Detox" experience called Demystifying AI, which provides a series of activities and reflection prompts for exploring various generative AI tools.
Lew Ludwig (co-director of the Denison University Center for Teaching and Learning) will be spending one day per week of his four-day-a-week essentials of calculus class developing an AI literacy overlay. Together, his students and he will actively explore generative AI, its uses, and implications. He will chronicle the journey in a column for the Mathematical Association of America: There and Back Again: A Mathematician's Tale of AI Exploration, which all are invited to join.
