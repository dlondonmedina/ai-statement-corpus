Developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are advancing rapidly. With the introduction of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, there are a lot of new ways you can use AI tools to assist you with your studies, but there are risks and pitfalls you should be aware of. 
Generative AI are technologies that allow computers to create images, music, video or text – often by accessing large sources of data from the internet. Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Wolfram Alpha, can be used to answer questions, calculate mathematical problems, write essays and generate computer code. 
Before you use AI tools, it’s important that you understand the risks.  
You can use AI responsibly as a helpful study tool to assist you in activities like summarising lecture notes, creating study prompts and brainstorming ideas.  
Using AI tools without caution can negatively affect your assessment results, impact your learning, or even result in serious academic consequences. There are many potential traps to be aware of when using AI to ensure you avoid any serious consequences. 
Make sure you don’t end up in trouble – check out the Library’s guide to using Artificial Intelligence responsibly. This guide will help you navigate how to get the most out of AI tools while using them responsibly. 
If you’re unsure about using Generative AI in your assessments, check with your lecturer or book an appointment with an Academic Skills and Language Advisor or Librarian.
