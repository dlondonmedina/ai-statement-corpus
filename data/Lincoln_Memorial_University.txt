Faculty and administrators are in the early stages of formulating policy to address AI in the classroom. Surveys by the Council of Independant Colleges and Primary Research Group suggest that most schools have yet to implement much. In the meantime, AI technology continues to improve with the recent release of GPT-4. Questions regarding plagiarism, authorship, and academic integrity are major concerns facing educators and administrators.
