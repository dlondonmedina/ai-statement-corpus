Imagine taking an honors seminar taught by Louisiana’s senior U.S. Senator on the
                        key issues facing the country. Or a course where you and a small team create your
                        own generative AI (artificial intelligence) large language model, under the tutelage
                        of LSU’s chief academic officer. Both classes were on offer this past fall at the
                        Ogden Honors College, and the results were stupendous, according to Dean Jonathan
                        Earle.
“Sometimes Honors classes are the most nimble place to try something brand-new on
                        a University campus,” said Dean Jonathan Earle. “We were fortunate this term to have
                        two sui generis seminars that couldn’t have been more timely, or fit into the disciplinary
                        boxes of LSU’s other colleges.”
After the launch of Open AI’s “ChatGPT” chatbot in the late fall of 2022, Earle and
                        LSU’s Executive Vice President & Provost Roy Haggerty began discussing how the University
                        and the Honors College could take a leadership role in the new world of machine learning
                        that had burst on the scene. Generative AIs like ChatGPT are based on large language
                        models which users prompt and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format,
                        style, level of detail, and language. “LSU needs to be on the forefront of how to
                        devise and build the next generation of AI, and not just looking to block students
                        from using them to write their homework assignments,” Earle said. 
HNRS 3035: Large Language Model (LLM) Development and Deployment for Real-World Applications
                        stands out as one of LSU's first classes in developing artificially intelligent applications.
                        Provost Haggerty was joined in the classroom by Dr. James Ghawaly, Senior Research
                        Scientist AI & Machine Learning in the Stephenson Disaster Management Institute, and
                        Mr. Henry Hays, CEO of DisruptREADY. 
Earle said the course was tailor-made for the type of interdisciplinary collaboration
                        that the best honors classes typify, inviting students from various fields to come
                        together to solve real-world problems using LLMs. While it may seem the realm of computer
                        science and business majors only, the course has proven to be beneficial for students
                        like Ogden Honors senior Colin Raby, who is majoring in mechanical engineering. "To
                        be selected as part of this forward-thinking inaugural class on building artificially
                        intelligent LLM applications was a premier educational opportunity,” Raby said. “I
                        look forward to continuing to develop our 'FarmSmart AI' agricultural intelligence
                        application alongside other smaller LLM applications aimed at making a wide range
                        of different systems more efficient and effective."
Raby's sentiments echo the great impact the course has had on shaping perspectives
                        on the future of technology and its role in society. “This experience has profoundly
                        shaped my perspective that the question is no longer if AI will change our jobs and
                        society, but how those harnessing AI will lead the evolution of every industry. LSU
                        and the Honors College’s commitment to equipping us with these crucial skills underscores
                        their foresight in nurturing leaders prepared to wield this transformative technology."
Haggerty said the next step is to offer a new version of the honors course that will
                        invite companies and organizations from the greater Baton Rouge area to sponsor a
                        team of LSU students and company representatives to build an LLM AI project that addresses
                        relevant challenges. “AI technology enables us to manage huge amounts of data and
                        find answers to myriad questions faster than ever before,” said Haggerty. “This type
                        of partnership will develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead in the AI space,
                        right here at Louisiana’s flagship university.”
Another unique and exclusive opportunity was presented to Ogden honors students fortunate
                        enough to enroll in HNRS 2033: Navigating Policy and Governance, a captivating course
                        led by U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Dr. Mike Rolfsen. According to Earle,
                        Cassidy and Rolfen’s seminar was not merely a classroom experience but a journey into
                        the intricacies of policy-making, the legislative process, and the profound impact
                        of effective governance on society.
The course delved into national security, climate, foreign policy, and trade issues,
                        and offered a unique blend of in-depth analysis, case studies, and open dialogues.
                        Its learning objectives are meticulously crafted to emphasize critical thinking, research
                        skills, advocacy, and effective communication—essential skills for those aspiring
                        to be leaders in policy-making. “The seminars I was able to sit in were a special
                        kind of course discussion, where important issues were really cracked open. And the
                        Senator knew every student’s name and hometown, which blew my mind,” Earle said.
Gracie Thomas, an Ogden Honors sophomore majoring in international studies, agreed.
                        “Senator Cassidy's class was an extraordinary experience that surpassed all my expectations.
                        It provided me with a wealth of new knowledge, offering profound insights into the
                        intricate intersections between national and international issues. The complexity
                        of political decision-making was unveiled in a way that went beyond any other class
                        I've taken, encouraging me to engage in critical thinking at a depth I hadn't explored
                        before."
For Eden Robinson, a senior majoring in Philosophy with a concentration in law, ethics,
                        and social justice, the impact was equally profound: "This class has fueled a deep
                        sense of duty within me to actively participate in the civic process—embracing the
                        responsibility to contribute to the betterment of our society and uphold the principles
                        that make our nation great. Senator Cassidy's class was nothing short of transformative
                        – a blend of insightful lectures, engaging discussions, and an atmosphere that fostered
                        intellectual growth. It was an unparalleled experience; undoubtedly the best class
                        I have had the opportunity to take."
These unique opportunities showcase the Ogden Honors College’s dedication to providing
                        a transformative education, shaping leaders who will navigate the complexities of
                        critical areas like AI and governance in the ever-evolving landscape of the 21st century.
                        As Ogden Honors students expand their horizons and challenge their perspectives, they
                        seize the chance to be part of an exceptional learning experience that goes beyond
                        the classroom, preparing them for influential roles in their respective fields.
