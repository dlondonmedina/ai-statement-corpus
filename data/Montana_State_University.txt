Below are some examples of course expectations and policies around generative AI depending
                                 on what level of student use that you decide for your course and assignments.
***Please note these are not official MSU policies around generative AI use but give
                                    faculty a sense of how to create policies and expectations for their individual courses***  
The following example syllabus language may be used as guides or starting points as
                                 you develop your own AI usage policy for your course. 
In this course, you may utilize AI language models, including ChatGPT, as a resource
                                          to support your writing assignments. AI language models are powerful tools developed
                                          to generate text based on the input provided. It can provide suggestions, offer alternative
                                          phrasing, and help brainstorm ideas for your written work.
While the AI language models can help refine your writing, it is important to remember
                                          that it is an AI system and not a substitute for your critical thinking and creativity.
                                          If you choose to use this tool, apply it as a supplement to your writing process and
                                          not rely solely on its suggestions. Ultimately, you are responsible for the content
                                          and quality of your written assignment. Therefore, you should critically evaluate
                                          ChatGPT outputs for accuracy, potential bias, and relevancy.
When utilizing AI language models, it is essential to ensure that your writing remains
                                          original and properly attributed, including citing outputs or text generated by ChatGPT.
                                          Please see the How to cite ChatGPT in APA Style resource.
I encourage you to use AI language models to enhance your writing skills, experiment
                                          with its capabilities, and learn from its suggestions. If you have any questions or
                                          concerns regarding using AI language models for writing assignments, please discuss
                                          them with me.
By acknowledging and understanding the appropriate use of AI language models, you
                                          can effectively incorporate this tool into your writing process, harnessing its potential
                                          to improve your written work while maintaining academic integrity and originality.
This class will strive to create an environment that fosters learning, critical thinking,
                                          and effective communication. To achieve these goals, I have decided to prohibit the
                                          use of ChatGPT or similar tools during this course.
While ChatGPT and other language models can be powerful and useful tools in certain
                                          contexts, I believe that relying on them for this course undermines the learning objectives.
                                          I want you to develop your skills in independent thinking, problem-solving, and engagement
                                          with the subject matter. By restricting the use of AI language models, you will utilize
                                          your knowledge, creativity, and critical analysis to complete your assignments and
                                          actively participate in class discussions.
I understand that technology plays an increasingly prominent role in various aspects
                                          of our lives, and I acknowledge its potential benefits. However, in the context of
                                          this course, I believe that relying on personal effort and intellectual exploration
                                          will enhance your learning experience and contribute to your long-term development
                                          as a knowledgeable and well-rounded individual.
It is important to note that this requirement applies to all aspects of the course,
                                          including assignments, exams, and any form of communication related to the course
                                          content. Any use of AI language models, including ChatGPT, during these activities
                                          will be considered a violation student code of conduct.

                                          ChatGPT or similar platforms. As your instructor, I believe that leveraging the potential
                                          of such tools can greatly enhance your learning experience, critical thinking skills,
                                          and overall engagement with the subject matter. Therefore, I have decided to make
                                          the use of ChatGPT a requirement throughout this course.

Another strategy that can establish and clarify use is to partner with and engage
                                 students in an initial discussion around the responsible use of generative AI. This
                                 strategy can promote transparency with students and give them some agency in how it
                                 will be used, while making some students less likely to misuse it when they have input
                                 over this process and are aware of the consequences. Furthermore, this process can
                                 be an opportunity to point out and discuss Open AI’s limitations, including issues
                                 with inaccurate information and/or biased content that students could be accountable
                                 for. Here is an example of a policy and expectations created collaboratively between
                                 faculty and students Boston University Faculty of Computing and Data Sciences. This policy also requires students to show how and give credit to AI tools when
                                 they are used and expectations for how instructors will assess and possibly penalize
                                 merely reproducing AI output use by students and emphasizes using AI tools wisely
                                 and intelligently with the aim of deepening understanding of subject matter and to
                                 support learning.  
How to Cite Generative AI
If you decide to allow limited or full use of generative AI, provide resources and
                                             teach your students how to cite their use of content produced by the tool to avoid
                                             any misuse and misunderstandings. Just as you would with traditional sources, normalize
                                             this requirement with your students. The MLA and APA recommend citing AI in the following
                                             ways:
