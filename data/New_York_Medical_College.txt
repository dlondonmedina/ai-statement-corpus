New York Medical College official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence
https://guides.library.nymc.edu/AItools
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create text, images, computer code, music, and more. This guide will provide information about Academic Integrity and AI, AI tools, and Citing AI.  
Before using an AI tool for an assignment or in your research, you should carefully consider if it is appropriate. 
For assignments, check with your instructor to ensure that your use aligns with their expectations and does not violate academic integrity policy.
Check with journal policies regarding using AI tools in published work for research. Some journals do not allow any AI tools to be employed in the creation of an article, while many others have specific parameters regarding the use, disclosure, and acknowledgment of the use of AI tools. Consider where you hope to submit for publication and check that journal's policy.
