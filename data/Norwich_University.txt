The Norwich University AI center will offer a range of courses and training programs that cater to students and faculty with different levels of expertise, from introductory courses to advanced research seminars. These programs will cover machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, among others. Students and faculty can acquire the skills and knowledge needed to excel in their respective fields by gaining a solid foundation in AI.
Approaching the problem in a cross disciplinary approach, the AI Center will develop a basic understanding and practical application of advanced computing technologies. The curriculum scope will include the development of reliable, trustworthy, explainable, robust, fair, and secure models and systems applied to diverse commercial, scientific, and government activities/initiatives.
The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center's mission is to conduct multiple forms and levels of research, deliver educational programming, and create workforce development projects to meet the growing national and regional requirements for an advanced computing capable workforce.
AI is a multidisciplinary field that intersects with many other areas of study, such as mathematics, statistics, computer science, psychology, and neuroscience, to name a few. The Norwich University AI center can serve as a hub for interdisciplinary collaborations, bringing together researchers and students from diverse backgrounds to work on joint projects and solve complex problems. By fostering such partnerships, the center can enable discoveries and innovations that would be difficult to achieve in a siloed environment.
Artificial intelligence education helps develop future leaders who can utilize AI for beneficial purposes, such as medical advancements and military applications while mitigating its potentially harmful consequences.
To prepare students to work in real-world situations, the Center will adhere to the university's experiential educational philosophy and demonstrate how performance-based education programs that combine knowledge, research, policy experience, and hands-on training produce top-tier students.
AI has the potential to bring immense benefits to society, but it also poses significant ethical and social challenges. The Norwich University AI center can play a vital role in promoting ethical and responsible AI by offering courses and workshops that address issues such as bias, transparency, accountability, and privacy. By educating students and faculty on the ethical implications of AI, the center can help create a new generation of AI practitioners who are mindful of the societal impacts of their work.
By providing cutting-edge research opportunities, specialized coursework and training, interdisciplinary collaborations, and ethical and experiential education, the Norwich University AI center can help equip students and faculty with the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in a world shaped by AI.
Educating students and producing graduates in these fields is about national security, and it's also about competitiveness across all disciplines. We need to grow the next generation of leaders who understand the tools and can use and employ them to solve problems. By providing Norwich students and educators with these opportunities, we can produce graduates who can contribute to advancing and protecting the nation in the ever-evolving areas of cybersecurity and AI tactics.
The AI Center will be a trusted resource in our university and regionally for research and education, supporting the development of new ideas, technologies, and policy formation impacting advanced computing technologies.
