Oklahoma City University's Academic Honesty Policy is found on pages 34-35 of the 2023-24 Undergraduate Catalogs and pages 35-36 of the 2023-24 Graduate Catalog. It includes:
"Students are advised that cheating and plagiarism are not tolerated. The university expects all students to maintain a high standard of ethics in their academic activities. In this context, forms of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, cheating on tests, examinations or other class/laboratory work; involvement in plagiarism (the appropriation of another’s work and/or the unacknowledged incorporation of that work in one’s own, including works produced by artificial intelligence); collusion (the unauthorized collaboration with another person); misrepresentation of actions; and falsifying information."
