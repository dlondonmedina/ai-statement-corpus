Old Dominion University official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence content generation tools (AICGTs), such as ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Bing, DALL●E 2 and Midjourney, have the potential to transform the teaching, learning, and research landscape in higher education. By augmenting the human ability to generate ideas and create various forms of content, including text, images, digital art, sound, video, and programming code, AICGTs are slowly disrupting teaching practices and traditional models of knowledge creation. While some educators are excited about the pedagogical potential of these tools, others worry that they could undermine students' academic integrity, creativity, and critical thinking. The disruptive nature of these fast-paced AI tools is likely to redefine not only models of knowledge creation in academia, but also curriculum programs and the skills and knowledge associated with current and future job prospects. As these AI content creation technologies become more ubiquitous, it is increasingly important to develop a nuanced understanding of their capabilities and limitations without overestimating or underestimating their potential impact on education (healthy skepticism).  
To help you navigate this emerging landscape, the Center for Faculty Development has created a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses common questions about generative AI content.
We hope this useful resource will help you (1) understand the possibilities and the limitations of AICGTs for teaching and learning practices, content creation,  assessment integrity, etc.; (2) make informed decisions about how to incorporate AI-generated content into your teaching, learning, and research activities; (3) engage your students in a reflective, responsible, productive and ethical use of these tools in various teaching and learning activities; and finally (4) help you explore and perhaps reframe your own narrative about how AICGTs will influence your professional identity as an educator and as a scholar.
We encourage you to use this resource and share it with your colleagues. The FAQ will be updated regularly to keep you informed about the latest AI tools. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please contact us at cfd@odu.edu.
AI-generated content such as text, images, video, code, and other media is produced by artificial intelligence systems trained on massive datasets, using complex algorithms to generate output based on text prompts. Tools like GPT-4, Claude, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 can generate superficially realistic content on a wide range of topics and from user descriptions. While AICGTs offer exciting new opportunities for automated, creative content production, they also pose challenges regarding the veracity, originality, and ethics of the output. AI-generated material can be persuasive but might lack depth or have biases from its training data. Therefore, it's essential for educators and students to approach AI-produced content with caution, checking its accuracy against trusted references. By recognizing the innovative possibilities while continually staying in the loop by evaluating AICGTs content, we can thoughtfully integrate these rapidly evolving tools into teaching and learning in a measured, responsible way.
 
Reminder: Please keep in mind that the effectiveness of learning is highly dependent on how you design your assignments and acknowledge that AICGTs often give incorrect information. 
Note: The CFD does not endorse the use of AI tools exclusively for student work or to circumvent the actual student learning process. The ethical use of AICGTs must always be considered.
Note: Learning how AICGTs respond to your assessment tasks can help guide their redesign, taking into account the current limitations of these tools. However, be careful not to enter your exam questions into AICGTs, as this could become part of the training data used by these tools.
To discourage student reliance on AI-generated content while still providing opportunities for creativity, consider the following when designing your course assignments:
In addition, analysis, and application assignments force students to demonstrate deeper understanding. Descriptive responses are easier for AI to generate.
Instead of using AI-generated content, discuss academic integrity and learning implications with students. Help them think through how AI tools should or should not be incorporated into the course. Alternatively, invite students to think about how they might incorporate AI-generated content into their course activities, while considering the impact on their creativity and learning journey.
Depending on your course learning outcomes and expectations, consider adopting or modifying one of the following examples:
Note: Please note that ODU does not require an AI statement in your syllabus, but it is highly recommended.
 
Provide clear guidelines for citing AI-generated content:
Example: (OpenAI's ChatGPT AI language model, "prompt", "draft", March 1, 2023).
Accuracy and bias: AI-generated content may not always be accurate or unbiased. Some tools, such as ChatGPT, may even create information or references that do not exist.
Current knowledge: AICGTs have a limited understanding of world events that have occurred after 2021. However, newer versions of the AICGT are able to search the Internet, read links and provide updated information.
Conversational responses: ChatGPT, for example, remembers past prompts and can adapt responses. This in-context learning is often used to circumvent ChatGPT's internal safeguards.
Availability: Unless you have a paid monthly subscription, some AIGCTs like ChatGPT may not always be available.
User Data: AIGCTs collect user data, so it is important not to share any personal information.
AI Writing Check
Caution: Uploading student work to external AI detection tools may result in FERPA, privacy, and copyright violations.
Reminder:  Remember that AI detectors provide probabilities, not definitive proof of student misconduct. Their results may be inconsistent, and students may manipulate content (e.g., use multiple AI paraphrasing tools such as Quilbot) to avoid detection. If you suspect academic dishonesty based on these tools, please review, and investigate before taking disciplinary action. The accuracy and reliability of these systems are limited, and your judgment in determining authorship remains critical.
Note: As of July 25, 2023, OpenAI has shut down its AI Classifier, a tool that claimed to flag AI-generated text, due to "low accuracy".
