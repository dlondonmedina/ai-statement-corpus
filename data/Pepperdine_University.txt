How to integrate or limit the use of ChatGPT, Bing AI, Bard and others
NOTE: The information and examples listed below as resources for faculty to consider
                  when teaching. It is to the discretion of each instructor how AI will be used within
                  the course.
 
Generative AI like ChatGPT, BingAI, and Google Bard are AI chatbots built with large
                  language model (LLM) deep learning neural network architecture. It is pre-trained
                  on a wide corpus of text data to generate human-like responses to textual prompts.
                  Since ChatGPT's release in the fall of 2022, continued investments and innovation
                  in AI has grown tremendously in this space.
As time is passing by, AI is advancing too and can not only do text, but also image,
                  voice and video generation.
When prompted with "How will chatGPT change higher education," ChatGPT generated the
                  following text:
Chat GPT has the potential to impact higher education in several ways:
Accessible Learning: Chat GPT can make education more accessible by providing on-demand,
                        personalized assistance to students. It can offer explanations, answer questions,
                        and provide guidance outside of traditional classroom settings. This can be especially
                        beneficial for students who have different learning styles or who may not have immediate
                        access to teachers or resources.
Supplemental Learning: Chat GPT can act as a valuable supplement to traditional educational
                        materials. It can offer additional explanations, examples, and practice problems to
                        reinforce concepts taught in class. Students can use it as a tool to deepen their
                        understanding and address specific areas of difficulty.
Virtual Tutors and Mentors: Chat GPT can serve as virtual tutors or mentors, offering
                        personalized guidance to students. It can provide feedback on assignments, suggest
                        study strategies, and offer career advice. This can enhance the learning experience
                        by providing individualized support, especially in subjects where one-on-one attention
                        is limited.
Language Learning: Chat GPT can assist in language learning by engaging in conversation
                        and providing real-time feedback. Students can practice their language skills, ask
                        questions, and receive corrections, helping them improve their proficiency and fluency.
Research and Information Retrieval: Chat GPT can aid in research and information retrieval
                        by helping students locate relevant resources, providing summaries of articles, and
                        offering guidance on the credibility and quality of sources. It can save students
                        time and assist them in finding the most relevant information for their studies.
It's important to note that while Chat GPT can be a valuable tool, it should not replace
                     the role of educators. Human interaction, critical thinking, and hands-on experiences
                     are essential components of higher education. Chat GPT should be seen as a supportive
                     tool that complements the learning process rather than a complete substitute for traditional
                     education. (OpenAI, ChaptGPT, July 2023).
In practice, Generative AI is being used in a "co-pilot" mode, where humans and machines
                     work together to produce business value through machines delivering baseline output
                     and humans improving upon this. Recognizing that working with Generative AI in a "co-pilot"
                     mode will become a component of future work.
 
 
ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can do an array of items, from writing papers to solving
                  analytical problems.
Below are some ways on how AI can be an asset in the classroom.
But like many things, AI has its flaws. AI is still an evolving machine and does not
                  always produce accurate or reliable information. AI is based upon existing data and
                  has admitted "to reproduce biases and stereotypes that exist". In addition, AI provides
                  the same information based upon a model's output, limiting the data provided and creating
                  an uniform response to a question. This may hinder the students ability to "develop
                  their own unique perspectives." Please note from a model perspective: Different outputs
                  can arise from the same inputs due to the architectures of many of these models. It
                  also can account for user preferences and be adjusted further to produce novel results
                  (e.g., at the code level, producing more or less creative responses involves adjusting
                  its "temperature" parameter). It also depends on some other factors like context length
                  that can be model dependent.
 
 
Below are some suggestions in how we reduce the use of AI in the classroom.
