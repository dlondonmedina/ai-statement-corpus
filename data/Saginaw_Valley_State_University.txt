In her exciting new book The Battle for Your Brain, Nita Farahany offers a much-needed roadmap to navigate the fast-changing technological landscape of Artificial Intelligence and neuroscience. With the rapid advance of wearable neurotech and generative AI such as ChatGPT, we face important ethical questions about privacy, human rights, equity---and even what it means to be human. But these technologies, Farahany argues, are also an opportunity to transform how we learn, work, and live.
Bio: Nita Farahany is the Robinson O. Everett Distinguished Professor of Law & Philosophy and Founding Director of the Duke Initiative for Science & Society. Appointed by President Barack Obama to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, where she served for seven years, she currently serves on the National Advisory Council for the National Institute for Neurological Disease and Stroke. A widely-published scholar on the ethics of emerging technologies, she spearheads research on futurism, law, and ethical implications of emerging technologies for society.
