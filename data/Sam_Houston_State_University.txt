The higher-education community is responding to Artificial Intelligence (AI), and in particular one such AI tool, ChatGPT, with a mixture of consternation, trepidation, excitement, and a lot of anxiety. Inasmuch as AI seems to be the wave of the future, higher education needs to respond appropriately. Though it is acknowledged that information on AI changes almost daily, Professional and Academic Center for Excellence (PACE)  hosted a panel on the topic “To Get the Conversation Started,” at SHSU.
 Dr. Erin Owens published a resource guide at SHSU’s library, click the image to get started!
