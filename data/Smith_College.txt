Smith College official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence
https://www.smith.edu/academics/statistical-data-sciences
The Statistical & Data Sciences (SDS) Program links faculty and students from across the college interested in learning things from data. At Smith, students learn statistics by doing—class time emphasizes problem-solving and hands-on contact with data. Many courses employ student-driven projects that allow students to pursue their interest in fields such as economics, psychology, political science, sociology, engineering, biology, environmental science, neuroscience and geology.
The Statistical & Data Sciences Program hosts regular talks & lectures that are free and open to the public. No prior exposure to statistics is presumed. Stay tuned to our events page for exciting presentations coming up!
Please see the Western Mass Statistics and Data Science Meetup for additional events.
In keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person.

It is possible for a Smith student to obtain a master of science in statistics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in five years (four years at Smith plus one at UMass), through the Fifth Year MS in Statistics Program. Interested students should consult with the director of the program.
Students interested in pursuing graduate work in statistics or data science should consult with their major adviser to plan an appropriate course of study. In either case, a solid foundation in mathematics (calculus I, II, and III, as well as linear algebra) is essential.
The ASA maintains several lists of graduate programs in statistics that may help you find options that suit your needs.
As a newer discipline, programs in data science are still in their infancy. The ASA maintains a list of graduate programs in “Big Data”, although this should not be conflated with data science. A more comprehensive list of data science degree programs is maintained by datascience.community.

If you wish to declare an SDS major or minor and need an advisor, please fill out the SDS major/minor adviser request form.
Students interested in doctoral programs in Statistics should consider the Major in Mathematical Statistics jointly operated by SDS and MTH.
Please see the SDS section of the online course catalog for the most recent information.
A student who wishes to study statistics may place themself according to the following guidelines.
A student with prior work in calculus or discrete math at college should start with Introduction to Probability & Statistics (SDS 220 or SDS 201, 5 credits). This is the recommended statistics course for biological sciences majors, and satisfies the basis requirement for engineering, environmental science, neuroscience and psychology. This is also the recommended course for a student who took AP statistics but didn't take the exam, or received a grade of 3 or below. ECO 220 is also a course at this general level.
A student with four years of high school math (but little or no calculus) should select SDS 201 or PSY 201 (Statistical Methods for Undergraduates). SDS 201 also satisfies the basis requirement for psychology. Other introductory courses at this level include GOV 203 and SOC 201.
A student with less preparation should select SDS 107 (Statistical Thinking) or SDS 109 (Communicating with Data).
A student who received a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Statistics Exam should take SDS 290 (Research Design and Analysis) or SDS 291 (Regression Analysis).
Please see the guidelines for Picker Engineering majors.
This page is intended to help EGR majors and their advisers identify appropriate courses at other universities that will satisfy the statistics requirement for the EGR major. It supplements the memo sent to EGR faculty on February 20, 2017. As noted in that memo, “equivalence of courses taken elsewhere [are] determined by...[a] qualified member of the SDS program.” Herein, we delineate the criteria used to determine equivalence in order to promote transparency and ensure a uniform experience for all.
The following criteria are used to verify that a course taken to satisfy the statistics requirement for the EGR major (hereafter “COURSE”) is satisfactory:
Exception: Students who have earned a 4 or 5 on the AP statistics exam can waive these requirements. They can fulfill their statistics requirement by taking any non-introductory course in probability or statistics (e.g., MTH 246, SDS 290, SDS 291, SDS 293, etc.).
SDS faculty will use the following set of questions to guide their thinking on whether a course meets the above criteria. Normally, a replacement course would satisfy all or nearly all of these questions.
EGR majors should consult this page first, and then present a syllabus (preferably electronic) to the SDS study abroad adviser. Although SDS 220 is a 5-credit course, the number of credits is not a determining factor.
For reference only, we provide a list of previously approved courses. Courses change over time and vary by instructor -- students should understand that just because a course was previously approved in the past does not guarantee that it will be approved in the future.

Think statistics is just about calculating things? Think again. 
The fields of statistics and data science are growing exceptionally fast. As technology continues to reshape our world, more and more data are being collected on any number of subjects. There is a growing belief among decision makers that these data can be useful. Yet the process of transforming data into actionable information is challenging.
To analyze modern streams of data, government agencies, nonprofits (NGOs) and private industries seek data analysts with technical skills (programming ability), the ability to reason quantitatively about data and uncertainty, and strong communication skills (in written, oral and visual forms). People with these skills are in high demand.
Statisticians use their deep understanding of mathematics and probability theory to reason about variation and uncertainty in data. For example, if a drug was observed to have a positive effect on patient outcomes in a clinical trial, was that effect large enough—given the sample size and assumptions about how the data was collected—to justify concluding that the drug actually worked? Statisticians build, validate and interpret models. They design experiments and collaborate with scientists of all stripes to make precise estimates of unknown quantities.
Data science is an emerging field that combines elements of mathematics, statistics and computer science to extract meaning from data. Data scientists work with large, complex, messy and live data sources. Often working on questions that are not well-defined, data scientists use their creativity and technical ability to dig deep into "Big Data." They build models, make predictions, and develop static and dynamic ways to visualize data.
While at Smith, statistics students have created innovative classroom activities, authored honored theses, developed sophisticated statistical software and contributed to the Office of Institutional Research. Graduates have found internships with the National Institutes of Standards and Techonology and the New York Mets, employment with Google, MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory, and MassMutual’s Data Science Development Program. Student have also gone on to graduate school at UC Berkeley, The Harvard School of Public Health, Ohio State University, and the University of Massachusetts.
The program awards an annual prize to a student majoring in SDS who performed outstanding research during her time at Smith. The faculty meets every spring to review the research projects they have supervised and select the prize recipient, who is then notified at the annual Awards Ceremony the day before Commencement.
Awardees
The Five College Statistics prize is awarded to one student at each of the Five Colleges, at their discretion. The award may be presented to a student satisfying any one of the following criteria (based on faculty vote from that institution):

The class project competition is for undergraduate students who conduct projects as part of an introductory or intermediate level statistics course. Most projects submitted to the USCLAP competition involve analyzing real data using existing statistical techniques. Students may choose any topic on which to conduct a study and students may use existing data or collect their own.

The research project competition is for undergraduate students who conduct research projects coming from activities like summer research projects, senior capstone course research projects, independent research projects (e.g., independent studies), Honor's college research projects, or extension of class research projects. Some submissions to USRESP are applied research projects using existing statistical/analytical techniques to solve real world problems, which others are involve methodological research involving statistical applications or simulation studies evaluating different techniques. Students may collect their own data or use existing data and students can select any topic to study.
