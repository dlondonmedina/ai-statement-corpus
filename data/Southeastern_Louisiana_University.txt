Artificial Intelligence
The use of generative AI tools in higher education is rapidly expanding and forever
                                 changing the way we teach and conduct research.  These tools are very exciting and
                                 transformational, while also being challenging.  It is incumbent upon instructors
                                 to learn about these tools and how they may directly influence the teaching and learning
                                 process in their individual courses.  While many are embracing these new tools and
                                 incorporating them into their instruction, others are electing to limit or prohibit
                                 their use altogether.  Therefore, individual faculty members must decide for themselves
                                 how generative AI tools will be used in their classes and inform their students accordingly.
                                  Whether permitting, prohibiting, and/or limiting the use of these tools, faculty
                                 should establish guidelines and communicate them clearly to their students.  Students
                                 found to be utilizing generative AI tools in courses where use is expressly prohibited
                                 will be subject to the penalties outlined in the Academic Integrity Policy.   
Generative AI is a type of intelligence that uses machine learning algorithms and
                                 large data sets to create new, original content.  Through the use of generative AI
                                 tools, the user can generate text, images, audio, videos, code, and more. But, use
                                 does not come without risks.  Potential biases and prejudices exist with AI generated
                                 data, and large language models, like ChatGPT, are known to make up information or
                                 hallucinate. Because information entered at prompts is stored, personal information
                                 should never be shared.
Provided below is a very small sample of the types of generative AI tools.  The examples
                                 are for creating awareness only.  Southeastern does not endorse or promote the use
                                 of any of these tools.       
 
The University of Louisiana System's Bridging the Divide Summer 2023 Series featured
                                 several sessions on Artificial Intelligence that included Southeastern's Dr. Elizabeth
                                 Hornsby, the ULS Content Expert for Online Teaching and Learning.  View the sessions
