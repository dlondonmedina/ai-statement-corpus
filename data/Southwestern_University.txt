                  The Computer Science Department provides an integrated approach to solving complex, open-ended problems—a skill necessary for succeeding in the digital age and beyond. When you major in computer science, you will be empowered to make a positive impact on the world. More than just learning how to code, you will theorize about systems while developing algorithms and gaining hands-on experiences with database management, taking advantage of the power of the cloud.
                

                  Beyond taking dynamic courses such as Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research, you can combine your interest in computer science with community engagement or your passion for the arts. Our recent students have
                

                  In addition to designing independent research with faculty, you will have the opportunity to present your work at regional, national, and international conferences and publish coauthored articles in peer-reviewed journals. You will also get support as you participate in national competitions, such as the Association for Computing Machinery’s International Collegiate Programming Contest. By graduation, you will be prepared to succeed in top-tier graduate programs as well as fulfilling careers, from network and test engineering to front- and back-end development.
