Note that in ALL cases, properly attributing the original creator is necessary.
 
Option 1: Use whatever you want and claim fair use.
Option 2: Pay to use professional stock images
Option 3: Use copyright-free stock photos provided by a free image source
Option 4: Use public domain or Creative Commons-licensed works
Option 5: Create your own images using Artificial Intelligence
