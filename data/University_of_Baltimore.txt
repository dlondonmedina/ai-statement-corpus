Almost a year has passed since the launch of ChatGPT, a groundbreaking tool that marked a significant leap in the field of artificial intelligence. This anniversary presents an opportune moment to reflect on the strides we've made in understanding and harnessing AI's potential, particularly here at the University of Baltimore.
 


In the months following ChatGPT's launch, the AI landscape has witnessed rapid advancements. AI's capabilities have expanded from simple text generation to more complex tasks like data analysis, predictive modeling, and even creative endeavors. These advancements have sparked a global conversation on the implications of AI in our daily lives, reshaping industries, academia, and our approach to technology.
 


At UBalt, our response to these rapid changes in the AI landscape has been proactive and innovative. We've made notable strides in generative AI research and programming:
 


In line with our commitment to staying abreast of AI developments, we are also updating the AI pages on the CELTT Channel and the UBalt website.
