University of Nebraska - Lincoln official policy on generative AI Artificial Intelligence
https://teaching.unl.edu/resources/strategies-techniques/teaching-technology/ai-policy-creation/
Your syllabus is an essential document for conveying expectations to your students. You likely already have policies around late work, attendance, and other aspects of your course, so it is highly recommended that you think about how you might incorporate a policy related to A.I. use into your existing course structure. Thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all approach here since courses differ vastly from one another and there is wide variety in how instructors are incorporating A.I. into their courses.
Before we present some specific examples, here are a few things for you to consider:
Acceptable uses:
Unacceptable uses:
Other ethical considerations to keep in mind when using AI for college assignments:
The set of policies put in place an outright ban on any use of generative A.I.. For policies like these, we recommend being very clear with students why you have the policy that you do. Given how easy it is to use A.I. and how difficult it is for instructors to detect, these policies will be difficult to enforce making it particularly important to work on getting student buy in for the learning process.
