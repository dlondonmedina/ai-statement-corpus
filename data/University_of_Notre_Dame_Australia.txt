You must confirm whether the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been explicitly allowed or is required in your assessment task. Otherwise, using AI to complete your assessment is a form of plagiarism and may also be a form of contract cheating under University policy.
At present, there are no specific guidelines for referencing AI tools using the Chicago Referencing Style. In the interim use the guidelines for web sources.
You need to credit ChatGPT and similar tools whenever you use the text that they generate in your own work. But for most types of writing, you can simply acknowledge the AI tool in your text (e.g., “The following recipe for pizza dough was generated by ChatGPT”). When a formal citation is required - a numbered footnote or endnote - follow the example below:
First Footnote
1. Text generated by ChatGPT, March 7, 2023, OpenAI, https://chat.openai.com/chat.
If f the prompt hasn’t been included in the text, it should be included in the note:
2. ChatGPT, response to “Explain how to make pizza dough from common household ingredients,” March 7, 2023, OpenAI.
Subsequent Footnotes
OpenAI, ChatGPT
Reference list
Do not include an entry in the reference list, as the information is not retrievable.
Appendix
If the full response has not been included in-text then include an appendix containing the full transcript of any prompts and AI-generated responses.

Titles: [14.206] Titles of webpages or sections are capitalised headline-style and placed in quotation marks. Titles of websites are capitalised headline-style without quotation marks and not italicised.
Titles of blogs are italicised and titles of blog posts are placed in quotation marks.
If in doubt about whether something is a blog or a website, treat the title like that of a website.
Dates: [14.207] Include a publication date or date of revision or modification (a copyright date is also acceptable). If a date cannot be found, include an access date in the first footnote and bibliography citations.
Page numbers: [14.22] Page numbers, if available, are required for all footnotes. In the absence of page numbers (e.g. as in the case of some online sources), give the section heading, chapter or paragraph number (if available), or a descriptive phrase.
