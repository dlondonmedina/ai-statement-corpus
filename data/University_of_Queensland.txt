Confirm with your course coordinator or check your course profile before using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in your assessment. Some assessment pieces do not permit the use of AI tools, while others may allow AI with some limitations.
Any permitted use of AI for assessment must be acknowledged appropriately. Your course coordinator will provide guidance on how to reference the use of AI tools. Some possible examples include:  
Note: Information about using and referencing ChatGPT and other generative AI tools in assignments and publications will continue to be updated. Check this page regularly to keep up with any changes (last updated 17 April 2023).
AI models sometimes produce incorrect, biased or outdated information. Verify the accuracy of AI-generated content using reliable sources before including it in your work.
Additionally, there may be legal or ethical issues to consider when using AI. Works created by non-humans are not eligible for copyright protection under Australian law. If you intend to publish work incorporating AI-generated content, check the publisher guidelines about what is allowed.
When interacting with AI models, you should be cautious about supplying sensitive information, including personal, confidential or propriety information or data.

Where an assignment requires ChatGPT to be cited, you must reference all the content from Generative AI tools that you include. Failure to reference externally sourced, non-original work can result in Academic misconduct.
References should provide clear and accurate information for each source and should identify where they have been used in your work.
For many referencing styles, there are no specific guidelines for citing ChatGPT or other generative AI.
Content from generative AI is a nonrecoverable source as it can't be retrieved or linked.
We recommend that you base the reference for generative AI content on the reference style for personal communication or correspondence, unless the referencing style has specific guidelines.
Check the referencing style used in your course for how to cite generative AI or follow the format of the following examples for different styles.
Based on APA Style guidance.
