In November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer),
                                    which prompted conversations among educators about its potential to impact the higher
                                    education landscape. This resource page was developed to help faculty learn about
                                    ChatGPT and its implications for teaching and learning. The information and recommendations
                                    on this page will be updated as more is learned about this technology.
ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that uses machine learning
                                          models to produce human-like text in response to a question, prompt, or instructions.
                                          It was trained on large amounts of text data and can generate natural language text
                                          in response to user prompts given to it. ChatGPT is optimized for generating responses
                                          in the form of conversations.  
ChatGPT was trained in writing using content that already exists on the Internet up
                                          to the year 2021. It generates responses to questions and prompts by predicting the
                                          next words or phrases that are most likely to follow based on the context of the conversation.
                                          Users type a question or prompt in the text box and then ChatGPT produces a response.
                                          Users can continue the conversation by typing follow-up questions or prompts. ChatGPT
                                          remembers what was previously discussed and produces more text. It recognizes, summarizes,
                                          and predicts text based on its giant data sets.
If you ask a question, ChatGPT will answer it. This is like giving a command to Google.
                                       Google produces sources for you to extract the information yourself while ChatGPT
                                       produces a written-out answer. Unlike a Google search, ChatGPT can conversationally generate full paragraphs of text.
ChatGPT can easily write content based on a prompt. For example, you can ask it to
                                       generate a piece of text, like writing a poem. The prompt can include what length
                                       and writing style for the piece. Also, you can ask for sources to be cited and even
                                       specify that you want only ‘real sources’ but be aware that these will not always
                                       be accurate.
You can provide ChatGPT with pieces of text and ask the chatbot to summarize, paraphrase,
                                       translate, remove spelling mistakes, give feedback on them, and so on.
If asked to perform multiple tasks at once, ChatGPT struggles to prioritize them,
                                       which might lead to a decrease in effectiveness and accuracy. It performs best when
                                       given a single task or objective to focus on.
ChatGPT might produce references that do not correspond to the text created. It might
                                       give fake citations that mix real publications from multiple sources.
The current version of ChatGPT was trained using data from up to the year 2021. This
                                       means that the chatbot cannot interpret more recent data.
ChatGPT might sometimes generate nonsensical or inaccurate responses to certain questions
                                       or situations. It cannot detect subtle emotional cures or respond appropriately to
                                       complex emotional situations.
Responses may not be entirely accurate in terms of context or relevance, providing
                                       incorrect, oversimplified, unsophisticated, biased, inappropriate, or irrelevant content.
The trained data may contain biases or prejudges. ChatGPT may sometimes generate responses
                                       that are unintentionally biased or discriminatory.
ChatGPT cannot access all the knowledge that humans possess. It may not be able to
                                       answer questions about very specific or niche topics. Also, it may not be aware of
                                       recent developments or changes in certain fields.
In addition to content errors, ChatGPT makes computational and logic errors. ChatGPT
                                       is a language model and not a calculator.  Text is generated in response to mathematical questions with a random number as the
                                       outcome, which may not be correct.
The quality of the content generated by ChatGPT and other AI writing tools depends
                                          on the training data and specific prompts provided to the model. There is a risk that
                                          the generated content may contain errors or omissions or lack high quality.
There is a risk that using ChatGPT or other AI generative models to generate content
                                          may be perceived as plagiarism. It is important to properly cite any materials used
                                          to indicate which parts of the content were generated by a machine.
Models like ChatGPT are only as good as the data they are trained on. There is a risk
                                          that these models could be biased if they are trained on biased data. Take steps to
                                          mitigate it.
Generated content may result in a lack of originality because AI generative models
                                          are not capable of coming up with new ideas or insights on their own. Content is generated
                                          based on the data it was trained on. 
As people use AI generative, they help train it. Privacy concerns are applicable as
                                          with other places online that require getting an account and sharing information.
                                          By using ChatGPT, users consent to having potentially personal data stored and sold
                                          by OpenAI.
Get familiar with ChatGPT. Instructors and students need to learn how to effectively
                                          use ChatGPT in the teaching and learning process. Doing so includes training on how
                                          to use the system, how to formulate effective questions, and how to interpret responses.
Before using ChatGPT, it is important to clearly define the learning outcomes, assessments,
                                          instructional content, and activities for the course. This will help ensure that ChatGPT
                                          is used in a way that is aligned with the overall learning outcomes for the course.
Communicate to students what ChatGPT is and its limitations. ChatGPT is not perfect
                                          and may make mistakes or provide incomplete information. It is important to be clear
                                          with students about its limitations.
Students may need guidance on how to use ChatGPT effectively, including how to phrase
                                          questions, how to interpret responses, and how to evaluate the quality of the information
                                          provided. It may be helpful to provide examples of effective and ineffective uses
                                          of ChatGPT.
ChatGPT can be used in conjunction with other instructional technologies, such as
                                          recorded video lectures and interactive simulations. This can help create a more engaging
                                          and interactive learning experience for students.
Incorporate ChatGPT as part of a larger instructional strategy: ChatGPT can be a valuable tool to support learning, users should not rely on it as
                                          the sole means of instruction. It is important to integrate ChatGPT into a broader
                                          instructional strategy that includes other forms of teaching practices, learning activities,
                                          and assessments.
It is important to continuously evaluate and refine ChatGPT use to ensure that it
                                          is meeting the learning objectives and to identify areas for improvement. This can
                                          involve analyzing student performance data and soliciting feedback from students and
                                          other instructors.
Emphasize the importance of academic integrity: Foster a culture of academic integrity by encouraging students to take responsibility
                                          for their own academic work, promoting honesty and integrity, and discouraging cheating
                                          and plagiarism.
Monitor student use of ChatGPT: To ensure that ChatGPT is being used effectively, encourage students to monitor their
                                          use of the tool. Identify any issues or concerns. This can be done through periodic
                                          check-ins, analyzing chat logs, or asking students to reflect on their own use of
                                          ChatGPT.
Monitor and evaluate ChatGPT performance: Instructors should regularly monitor and evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of
                                          ChatGPT in responding to student’s questions and concerns. This will help ensure that
                                          ChatGPT is providing accurate and helpful responses to students.
Authentic assessment: Use authentic assessments that reflect real-world scenarios and require students
                                       to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in practical applications. For example,
                                       you could ask students to design and carry out a scientific experiment or analyze
                                       a real-world case study.
Higher-order thinking: Design assessments that require higher-order thinking skills, such as critical thinking,
                                       problem-solving, and creativity. These types of assessments are less likely to be
                                       replicated by ChatGPT and require students to apply their knowledge and skills in
                                       novel ways.
Collaborative learning: Design assessments that require collaboration between students. ChatGPT may be able
                                       to assist with individual tasks, but it cannot replace the benefits of working in
                                       teams and engaging in collaborative learning. For example, you could ask students
                                       to work together on a group project or participate in a debate or discussion.
Feedback: Provide timely and constructive feedback to students on their performance. This can
                                       help students identify areas of strength and weakness and improve their learning outcomes.
                                       ChatGPT can provide automated feedback, but it cannot replace the value of personalized
                                       feedback from a human.
By using multiple assessments (i.e., traditional tests, essays, projects, presentations,
                                       and performance-based assessments), instructors can ensure that students are evaluated
                                       on a range of skills and knowledge, making it more difficult for ChatGPT to replicate
                                       the assessments.
Instructors should educate students on the importance of academic honesty and integrity.
                                          They should explain to students that using AI-powered tools like ChatGPT is not a
                                          substitute for their own critical thinking and analysis, and that they must ensure
                                          that their work is original and properly cited.
Instructors should provide students with clear instructions on how to use ChatGPT
                                          in their assignments. This includes guidelines on how to cite the tool as a source
                                          and how to integrate its output into their work.
Instructors should encourage students to think critically when using ChatGPT. They
                                          should explain that the tool is only as good as the input it receives, and that students
                                          must carefully evaluate the relevance and accuracy of the tool's output.
Instructors should monitor students' use of ChatGPT to ensure that they are using
                                          the tool ethically and responsibly. They should look for signs of plagiarism or other
                                          forms of academic misconduct.
Instructors should use multiple assessment methods to evaluate students' work. This
                                          can help reduce the temptation for students to rely solely on ChatGPT to complete
                                          their assignments.
Instructors should provide feedback on student work that highlights areas where they
                                          can improve their use of ChatGPT. This can include suggestions for how to better integrate
                                          the tool's output into their work or how to improve the relevance and accuracy of
                                          the tool's output.
Research Tool: ChatGPT can be used as a research tool to help students explore different topics
                                          and find answers to their questions. Instructors can encourage students to use ChatGPT
                                          to research topics related to their coursework or assignments and provide guidance
                                          on how to use the tool effectively.
Writing Assistance: ChatGPT can be used as a writing assistant to help students generate ideas and improve
                                          their writing skills. Instructors can encourage students to use ChatGPT to generate
                                          topic ideas, brainstorm content, and get feedback on their writing.
Language Practice: ChatGPT can be used as a language practice tool to help students improve their language
                                          skills. Instructors can encourage students to practice their writing or speaking skills
                                          by engaging in conversations with ChatGPT in the target language.
Interactive Learning: ChatGPT can be used as an interactive learning tool to engage students in interactive
                                          and personalized learning experiences. Instructors can design interactive learning
                                          activities using ChatGPT, such as quizzes, games, or simulations.
Customized Content: ChatGPT can be used to create customized content tailored to individual student needs.
                                          Instructors can use ChatGPT to generate personalized study materials for students,
                                          such as summaries of course content, flashcards, or study guides.

                                          for an exam or assignment. Grading criteria could include the quality and relevance
                                          of the study materials, the effectiveness of the materials in helping the student
                                          prepare, and the reflection on their learning experience.
