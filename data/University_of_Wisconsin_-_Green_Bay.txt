To help you as you research and explore AI tools, we have provided a list of resources and additional readings on the topic of Generative AI technology below.
Additionally, CATL developed a GenAI checklist for instructors that will help you assess the extent to which generative AI will affect your courses and provide guidance on steps for moving forward.
ChatGPT, built on the GPT-4 system, and other Generative AI platforms, offer unique opportunities for instructors and students to leverage the technology while still providing robust, comprehensive learning experiences.

Below you will find a variety of resources on how to use generative AI in classroom activities, with examples of activities that may not require any usage of AI.
