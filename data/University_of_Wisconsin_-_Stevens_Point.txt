Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development Secretary Amy Pechacek has focused her career on public service with an emphasis on government administration strategy, as well as crisis and risk management, having led DWD since September 2020 following previous roles as Deputy Secretary for the Wisco​​nsin Department of Corrections and leadership over numerous public programs for Milwaukee County. She chairs the Governor's Task Force on Workforce and Artificial Intelligence, which is bringing together leaders from business, agriculture, education, technology, labor, workforce development, and government to identify policies and investments that will advance Wisconsin workers, employers, and job seekers through the AI transformation. ​
Amy's early efforts at DWD turned the tide on a backlog of unemployment insurance benefit claims that arose during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and DWD is continuing its comprehensive modernization efforts under her leadership to improve customer service through tools such as machine learning and multi-language translation. Thanks to Gov. Tony Evers' historic investment in workforce development, Amy has integrated strategic new initiatives with longstanding DWD programs to reduce employment barriers and address a worker quantity challenge arising from demographic trends that have been decades in the making. 
Amy received her master's degree in public policy and public administration from Northwestern University and her undergraduate degree from UW-Madison in sociology and criminal justice; she also is a graduate of the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service's Senior Executive Institute at the University of Virginia.

While there is a lot
of noise out there about the practical impact of AI versus the potential impact
of AI, this presentation aims to educate attendees on the middle ground. We
will take a dive into the true capabilities of AI, beyond the Generative AI and
Machine Learning hype. Once we have you on the ship heading towards a world
that we never could’ve imagined, we’ll land the ship on what to expect over the
next 5 years. What new skills should you obtain? Where should your focus be?
This presentation is aimed to point you in the right direction.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly increasing presence in our world and daily lives. This technology is already creating unparalleled change in healthcare practice and education. But is healthcare ready for this innovation? Preparing practitioners to engage in the revolution? This presentation highlights where AI is currently influencing healthcare and what must be done to ensure a healthy AI future for all.​​​
This presentation will focus on developing and applying frameworks that enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness of AI tools in various sectors, including business, industry, and healthcare. We will introduce and delve into practical frameworks like the RPO model (Role, Process, Outcome), which guides users in creating structured and impactful AI prompts. By understanding these methodologies, attendees will learn how to harness the full potential of AI, turning raw computational power into tailored solutions for their specific needs. This session is a must for anyone looking to elevate their AI strategy and execution.
Health inequities in the U.S. healthcare system, which include disparities related to race, socioeconomic status, and sex/gender due to a continued lack of personalized patient care, are responsible for approximately $320 billion in annual healthcare spending. If these issues remain unaddressed, this figure could escalate to over $1 trillion by 2040. This must change.
In this presentation, we’ll explore the transformative role of AI in personalized patient care and how it will help usher in the necessary change required to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare. We’ll discuss and share examples of how AI-driven personalized care can address the costly burden of non-personalized treatments, as well as AI’s growing role in predictive analytics, personalized treatment plans, and cost reduction. For healthcare to serve everyone effectively it must become more personalized, and AI can help build a future where healthcare is more adaptive, patient-centric, and economically sustainable.​
