Teaching Action Groups (TAGs) are a series of three or more sessions focused upon a particular issue or strategy in teaching and learning. These advanced inquiry groups are highly participatory and limited in size. Participants should have some introductory knowledge of the topic, be willing to look critically at the topic, and apply what they have learned into their own teaching contexts.
Teaching Circles are book clubs where CTEL provides the books. Participants will meet 3-4 times during a one-month period to discuss insights or challenges that emerge from the work. This is a great, low-key opportunity to meet new colleagues and share ideas.
Teaching Matters is a group of faculty and staff who learn about teaching together. Teaching Matters are intensive semester-long experiences in which instructors are led through a structured process that allows them to learn about specific teaching strategies and create concrete innovations in their teaching practice.
Webinars cover a variety of topics. If you would like to watch pedagogical webinars on your own, you will be awarded a badge for every 60 minutes you watch. Send an email to ctel@washburn.edu with the title of the webinars and the date you watched them to receive your badge.
Workshops are 1-2 hour face-to-face presentations/discussions/activities that are designed to help faculty and staff learn more about teaching and learning. Our workshops are often collaborative endeavors with different faculty and staff facilitating.
Course design programs are usually multi-day opportunities where we work on course design principles and help guide course preparation for both in person and online courses (individual program descriptions will specify which course type it is targeting).
Each year CTEL helps design, coordinate, and/or sponsor events that address university-wide issues, and are targeted at generating open dialogue among faculty and staff around the issues of teaching and learning. Speakers will reflect on one of the central pillars that define CTEL (High Impact Practices, Diversity, Technology, Assessment, Pedagogy, Co-curricular Learning).

You are welcome to stop in for one or two workshops or stay all day. In each workshop you will engage with your actual course materials, so please bring along syllabuses, assignments, and other course documents. You will leave each workshop with revised and revived materials ready for the first week of classes. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided for participants.
(9:00-9:45) Formative Assessment Ideas with Kelly McClendon - Come discuss, share, and learn about formative assessment.  What is it? What are some examples you can have ready to use? How can you close the loop and make these assessment more useful for your students?
(10:00-10:45) Considering Student’s Basic Needs in Your Syllabus with Jason Miller - According to recent studies, more than 40% of college students in the United States are food insecure. These numbers are even higher for first generation, historically underrepresented, and lower income students—each a large population at Washburn. In this interactive workshop, learn more about why you should consider including a basic needs statement in your syllabus, how to craft a statement, and best practices for talking to your students about basic needs in ways that humanize and destigmatize asking for help. You’ll leave the session with a sample statement you can include in your fall syllabus and practical tools that are easy and quick to implement in your classroom!
(11:00-11:45) Reimagining Syllabi: Conversations that only teaching nerds get excited about with Emily Grant  - In a rapidly evolving educational landscape, the traditional course syllabus is ripe for innovation.  The presentation will offer some ideas on novel ways to craft and present course syllabi that foster student engagement and embrace the possibilities of technology. (Or at the very least, of something other than 12-point Times New Roman.)  These creative strategies can help us communicate essential course information but also make a positive first impression on our students.
(12:15-1:00) ChatGPT: What to know and how to prepare with Chris Jones - In this session, you’ll learn the basics of language-learning artificial intelligence and our institutional policies surrounding it. We’ll spend time playing with our own assignment prompts in ChatGPT, an AI platform. We’ll devote the majority of our time, however, to thinking about our own policies and procedures. We’ll review sample syllabus statements, and then we’ll workshop developing our own statements and presenting them to our students.
(1:15-2:00) Student Accommodations and the Interactive Process with Heather Center - This workshop will dive into ways to make the classroom more accessible for our students including: interactive process conversations, utilizing universal design, formatting for powerpoints or documents, and syllabus content.
(2:15-3:00) Student Self-Assessment as a Tool for Evaluating Participation with Justin Moss - Research shows that students benefit from participating in class discussions, but requiring participation creates a host of dilemmas for instructors. How do we assess participation in ways that don’t simply reward extroverted students while penalizing their introverted peers? How can we mitigate the effects of implicit bias, imposter syndrome, and the impossibility of keeping track of all students’ contributions? In this workshop, participants will learn about using student self-assessment to evaluate participation meaningfully and effectively. They will view sample tools for student self-assessment and develop materials for use in their own classes.
(3:15-4:00) The Faculty Resource Treasure Trove: A voyage of discovery with Sue Taylor-Owens - In this workshop, we'll take you on a voyage of discovery through the online resource centers, showing you where to find everything from faculty tutorials on how to use D2L to CTEL resources to help for students on how to use MyWashburn. We'll also share some tips on how to use these resources effectively. So whether you're a new faculty member or a seasoned veteran, this workshop is for you!

Discover the secret to flourishing in an age of division: belonging. In a world filled with discord and loneliness, finding harmony and happiness can be difficult. But what if the key to unlocking our potential lies in this deceptively simple concept? Belonging is the feeling of being a part of a group that values, respects, and cares for us―a feeling that we can all cultivate in even the smallest corners of social life. In Belonging: The Science of Creating Connection and Bridging Divides, Stanford University professor Geoffrey L. Cohen draws on his own and others’ groundbreaking scientific research to offer simple, concrete solutions for fostering a sense of belonging. These solutions can generate surprisingly significant and long-lasting benefits.

We are noticing it in our classrooms. The American College Health Association (2022) reported ~ 77% of undergraduate students “were experiencing moderate to serious psychological distress” (Bestcolleges.com, 2023).
Faculty and staff are often first to observe changes in students, or have students disclose concerns and issues. Most of us are not mental health professionals and feeling unsure of actions they can take and campus resources.
This Teaching Action Group uses an evidence-based approach using a trauma informed approach. Participants will not only learn what trauma informed teaching might look like in and out of the classroom, and how to adapt policies and procedures with a better understanding of how trauma impacts student learning.
All sessions will include insight for both online and in person teaching. Session topics include: defining trauma informed teaching, current practices and services at Washburn, classroom construction and management. Consideration regarding compassion fatigue and burnout from the faculty/staff perspective will be addressed.
*Trauma-informed Teaching Observation Triads are optional with this TAG.
Teaching Action Groups (TAGs) are a series of three or more sessions focused upon a particular issue or strategy in teaching and learning. These advanced inquiry groups are highly participatory and limited in size. Participants should have some introductory knowledge of the topic, be willing to look critically at the topic, and apply what they have learned into their own teaching contexts.

Following the current local and national high school policies impacting higher education as well as the Shawnee County Thrives Scholarship, this proactive Teaching Action Group seeks to conceptualize inclusive teaching within the Washburn context to understand and mitigate student-instructor challenges in this relatively new growing college climate.
As policies, times, and students change, where does that leave faculty members? As faculty members, we will re-evaluate practical ways to re-envision our pedagogy through a collaborative and translational perspective to help students succeed.
We will explore the general concepts in inclusive teaching that are important at a foundational level and that all who teach or will teach students should be aware of and professionally develop. Session topics include: Defining and characterizing inclusive instruction within the current Washburn context; The role of privilege in inclusive teaching; Recognizing, mitigating, and addressing bias; and finally, targeted application and implication within the pedagogical Washburn community.

The Hypothesis team will discuss how collaborative annotation with Hypothesis can be used to make student reading visible, active, and social in STEM courses. Social annotation’s collaborative and metacognitive nature can encourage students to tackle difficult concepts in a new way. For example, social annotation can assist students in identifying patterns and relationships, in analyzing the validity of arguments and/or solutions, and in locating and contextualizing important information in problems. Additionally, it can give instructors an opportunity to guide students through texts or course materials asynchronously.
In addition to sharing pedagogical best practices for collaborative annotation, the Hypothesis team will demonstrate how Hypothesis can be used with course readings in your LMS. Participants can expect to come away from this session with a clear idea about how they can start incorporating collaborative annotation into their courses to improve student success.

The authors skillfully invite assessment professionals into a dialogue about equity-centered practice. Then offer resources to engage in self-awareness, principles and models for practice, and the encouragement to act, to turn the belief that 'equitable assessment is what good assessment looks like' into reality.

Discover the secret to flourishing in an age of division: belonging. In a world filled with discord and loneliness, finding harmony and happiness can be difficult. But what if the key to unlocking our potential lies in this deceptively simple concept? Belonging is the feeling of being a part of a group that values, respects, and cares for us―a feeling that we can all cultivate in even the smallest corners of social life. In Belonging: The Science of Creating Connection and Bridging Divides, Stanford University professor Geoffrey L. Cohen draws on his own and others’ groundbreaking scientific research to offer simple, concrete solutions for fostering a sense of belonging. These solutions can generate surprisingly significant and long-lasting benefits.
