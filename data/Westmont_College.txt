Community Discussion: Designing Assignments with AI in ViewThursday, February 15, 3:30-5pm, Founders Room
Generative AI tools can be used to circumvent learning, but they might also be used to aid it. At a very practical level, then, the advent of generative AI will require instructors across most disciplines to rethink what their classroom assignments should achieve, and to modify those assignments accordingly. If you have an assignment you'd like to workshop with colleagues, please join us for a multidisciplinary conversation on Thursday, February 15. Please RSVP for that event below; in order to help us prepare for the discussion, we'll ask you on the response form to upload a specific assignment or prompt that you'd like to work on that afternoon.
