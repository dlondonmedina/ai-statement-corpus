The following guidelines were developed from and based on a draft provided by the AI Working Group.
AI detection is imperfect; instructors should use it with caution. The risk of a false positive can create situations where students are wrongly accused of academic dishonesty. Instructors therefore should not rely only on detection software to determine if an assignment was written by AI.
