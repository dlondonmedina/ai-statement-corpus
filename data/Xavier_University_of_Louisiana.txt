Originally presented at CAT+FD on Thursday May 25th and Friday May 26th, 2023 by CAT+FD Staff

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world, and Xavier faculty need to learn about AI in order to prepare their students for success in the 21st century. In this two-day “bootcamp,” Xavier faculty explored the potential benefits and risks of AI, including the use of AI to improve their teaching and research. Our ultimate aim is to help our students develop the skills they need “to contribute to the promotion of a more just and humane society” as we prepare them “to assume roles of leadership and service” (per our mission) — in a global society which will be increasingly conditioned by the use of AI systems.

One participant described the event as "really engaging (and intermittently mind-blowing)" as well as "the best 8 hours I spent this semester." We hope that even faculty who were unable to attend may have a similar experience, and so we are providing the resources below. They may also serve as a refresher for those who were there. 

Note: You will need to sign up for some AI platforms in order to complete this training. We recommend establishing an account with ChatGPT because it is considered state-of-the-art. Other possibilities include Bard (another chatbot) or StarryAI (image generator) but feel free to sign up with any platform that catches your interest, especially if it is tailored to your discipline.
